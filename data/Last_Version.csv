"  Booked a flight from Bucharest to Manchester with a 2h 45’ layover at Heathrow. Flight was delayed from Bucharest because of ATC strike. Arrived at Heathrow 40 minutes later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage (it’s a common problem with BA at Heathrow). I missed my connecting flight because of their delays and they told me I had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day. There was just a shameful 10£ food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous prices at LHR. No accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport. I asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuses that they are sorry, but they will not compensate anything.  I can’t imagine a worst airline than BA regarding customer care. It is not about money here but rather than the way they treat customers. It is the last time in my lifetime that I will be flying this joke of an airline.",Booked a flight from Bucharest to Manchester with a 2h 45 layover at Heathrow Flight was delayed from Bucharest because of ATC strike Arrived at Heathrow 40 minutes later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage its a common problem with BA at Heathrow I missed my connecting flight because of their delays and they told me I had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day There was just a shameful 10 food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous prices at LHR No accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport I asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuses that they are sorry but they will not compensate anything I cant imagine a worst airline than BA regarding customer care It is not about money here but rather than the way they treat customers It is the last time in my lifetime that I will be flying this joke of an airline,,"[('Booked', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Bucharest', 'n'), ('Manchester', 'n'), ('2h', None), ('45', None), ('layover', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('Flight', 'n'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('Bucharest', 'n'), ('ATC', 'n'), ('strike', 'n'), ('Arrived', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('40', None), ('minutes', 'n'), ('later', 'r'), ('scheduled', 'v'), ('still', 'r'), ('enough', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('catch', 'v'), ('connecting', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Unfortunately', 'r'), ('stranded', 'v'), ('plane', 'n'), ('waited', 'v'), ('long', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('disembark', 'v'), ('plane', 'n'), ('due', 'a'), ('lack', 'v'), ('staff', 'n'), ('slot', 'n'), ('shortage', 'n'), ('common', 'a'), ('problem', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('missed', 'v'), ('connecting', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('delays', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('wait', 'v'), ('night', 'n'), ('freezing', 'a'), ('airport', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('next', 'a'), ('day', 'n'), ('shameful', 'a'), ('10', None), ('food', 'n'), ('voucher', 'n'), ('joke', 'n'), ('considering', 'v'), ('ridiculous', 'a'), ('prices', 'n'), ('LHR', 'n'), ('accommodation', 'n'), ('offered', 'v'), ('sleep', 'v'), ('cold', 'a'), ('airport', 'n'), ('asked', 'v'), ('compensation', 'n'), ('sent', 'v'), ('long', 'a'), ('text', 'n'), ('lame', 'n'), ('excuses', 'v'), ('sorry', 'a'), ('compensate', 'v'), ('anything', 'n'), ('cant', 'v'), ('imagine', 'v'), ('worst', 'a'), ('airline', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('regarding', 'v'), ('customer', 'n'), ('care', 'n'), ('money', 'n'), ('rather', 'r'), ('way', 'n'), ('treat', 'v'), ('customers', 'n'), ('last', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('lifetime', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('joke', 'n'), ('airline', 'n')]",booked flight Bucharest Manchester 2h 45 layover Heathrow Flight delay Bucharest ATC strike arrive Heathrow 40 minute later schedule still enough time catch connect flight unfortunately strand plane wait long time disembark plane due lack staff slot shortage common problem BA Heathrow miss connect flight delay tell wait night freeze airport first flight next day shameful 10 food voucher joke consider ridiculous price LHR accommodation offer sleep cold airport ask compensation send long text lame excuse sorry compensate anything can not imagine bad airline BA regard customer care money rather way treat customer last time lifetime fly joke airline,-0.85,Negative
"  Booked online months ago and the only hitch was replacement aircraft meaning chosen seats were different. I was informed of this prior to departure so could amend. Bag drop at MAN T3 wasn't smooth but I suspect that was MAN fault. Shuttle boarding was slow and delayed meaning a rush at LHR T5. The flight to CPT was full but we left more or less on time. The cabin was clean and PE was what we expected, sufficient leg and arm room plus a few little perks with drinks. Only complaint is the seats actually recline too far. Staff were very good during the first few hours of service, especially George. Food was quite tasty but one option wasn't loaded. Breakfast was also quite tasty and we landed on time. The fly in the ointment is both our cases arrived late on the carousel and only later did we notice both had been broken into, likely at CPT.

"  As an infrequent flyer, British Airways was always my first choice. With some reassurance and comfort of service, quality, luggage allowance etc. In fact I’ve never flown with the budget airlines. My most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am I actually getting for my money and is BA what they once were. While the flights were around an hour delayed both ways, the cabin and ground staff service were ok. It is the facilities (or lack of) that I am most disappointed by. The flight was Approx 4 and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake. In fact on my return journey I wasn’t even offered the water! To top it off BA no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away. There wasn’t even the obligatory flight journey. The WiFi was poor. I couldn’t even access the shop. However, for a fee so much more was available. This explains BAs record profit of £1.52bn. So, the question is, what am I paying for? I will now for sure opt for the budget airlines. They are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for, which I can decide to choose or not. As BA now stands for Basic Airways I’ll go elsewhere and get basic for cheaper.",As an infrequent flyer British Airways was always my first choice With some reassurance and comfort of service quality luggage allowance etc In fact Ive never flown with the budget airlines My most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am I actually getting for my money and is BA what they once were While the flights were around an hour delayed both ways the cabin and ground staff service were ok It is the facilities or lack of that I am most disappointed by The flight was Approx 4 and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake In fact on my return journey I wasnt even offered the water To top it off BA no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away There wasnt even the obligatory flight journey The WiFi was poor I couldnt even access the shop However for a fee so much more was available This explains BAs record profit of 152bn So the question is what am I paying for I will now for sure opt for the budget airlines They are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for which I can decide to choose or not As BA now stands for Basic Airways Ill go elsewhere and get basic for cheaper,,"[('infrequent', 'a'), ('flyer', 'n'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('always', 'r'), ('first', 'a'), ('choice', 'n'), ('reassurance', 'n'), ('comfort', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('quality', 'n'), ('luggage', 'n'), ('allowance', 'n'), ('etc', 'n'), ('fact', 'n'), ('Ive', 'n'), ('never', 'r'), ('flown', 'v'), ('budget', 'n'), ('airlines', 'n'), ('recent', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('changed', 'v'), ('view', 'n'), ('causes', 'v'), ('reflect', 'v'), ('actually', 'r'), ('getting', 'v'), ('money', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('flights', 'n'), ('around', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('ways', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('ground', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('ok', 'a'), ('facilities', 'n'), ('lack', 'n'), ('disappointed', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Approx', 'n'), ('4', None), ('half', 'a'), ('hours', 'n'), ('thing', 'n'), ('offered', 'v'), ('half', 'a'), ('cup', 'n'), ('water', 'n'), ('poured', 'v'), ('bite', 'a'), ('sized', 'a'), ('banana', 'n'), ('slice', 'n'), ('cake', 'n'), ('fact', 'n'), ('return', 'n'), ('journey', 'n'), ('wasnt', 'v'), ('even', 'r'), ('offered', 'v'), ('water', 'n'), ('top', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('longer', 'r'), ('media', 'n'), ('screen', 'n'), ('select', 'v'), ('something', 'n'), ('pass', 'v'), ('time', 'n'), ('away', 'r'), ('wasnt', 'a'), ('even', 'r'), ('obligatory', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('journey', 'n'), ('WiFi', 'n'), ('poor', 'a'), ('couldnt', 'v'), ('even', 'r'), ('access', 'n'), ('shop', 'n'), ('However', 'r'), ('fee', 'n'), ('much', 'r'), ('available', 'a'), ('explains', 'v'), ('BAs', 'n'), ('record', 'n'), ('profit', 'n'), ('152bn', None), ('question', 'n'), ('paying', 'v'), ('sure', 'a'), ('opt', 'n'), ('budget', 'n'), ('airlines', 'n'), ('transparent', 'a'), ('offer', 'v'), ('pay', 'v'), ('decide', 'v'), ('choose', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('stands', 'v'), ('Basic', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('Ill', 'n'), ('go', 'v'), ('elsewhere', 'r'), ('get', 'v'), ('basic', 'a'), ('cheaper', 'a')]",infrequent flyer British Airways always first choice reassurance comfort service quality luggage allowance etc fact I ve never fly budget airline recent flight change view cause reflect actually get money ba flight around hour delay way cabin ground staff service ok facility lack disappointed flight Approx 4 half hour thing offer half cup water pour bite sized banana slice cake fact return journey be not even offer water top BA long medium screen select something pass time away be not even obligatory flight journey WiFi poor could not even access shop however fee much available explain bas record profit 152bn question pay sure opt budget airline transparent offer pay decide choose BA stand Basic Airways Ill go elsewhere get basic cheap,-0.296,Negative

"  London Heathrow to Gibraltar on 24th October 2023. I shall start by reference to the booking process. I used the BA website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect. The flight was due to depart from terminal 3 but the passengers were bussed for a good 15 minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand. When boarding the flight the cabin-crew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight. The captain made 3 brief announcements during the flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight. The lack of catering was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible “breakfast bar” one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge points did not work either. Given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service. The system BA have in place is not good enough. The flight arrived on-time. The disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen. The crew were wearing the new BA uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between this BA service and that of so-called “budget” rivals. On this route BA have a monopoly and so I did not have an option to use the services of a different company.",London Heathrow to Gibraltar on 24th October 2023 I shall start by reference to the

"  I flew London to Cairo and return in October 2023. It was basically a perfectly good pair of flights in Economy, with pleasant and professional cabin crew (especially on the return journey). Being only 1.73 m tall I have no problem with legroom in the back of the plane, the seat was OK if getting a little numbing after 5 hours, and the return of a rather good included snack box and drinks was welcome. However, it must be said that the value for money was poor: with a checked bag on the return leg only, this was a nearly £700 ticket.

"  Absolutely the worst experience ever.  Flew into Heathrow, no problem. Waited for 5 hours, three extra hours, for our connection to Porto then the cancelled the flight.

Because we missed the connection (their fault), they cancelled our return flights. After two hours on the phone with customer service from the Madrid airport, they booked us a new return flight, then they made is pay $ 1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto. Then, for no reason they cancelled our return flight again! After hours, and hours and hours with customer service, we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight.

"   Our BA flight from Porto to London Heathrow T5 was operated by Finnair using a Finnair plane and crew. This had been advised by BA shortly after booking, with the option to change flights if we preferred. Although the business class cabin was of a similar layout to BA Club Europe, i.e. with the middle seat kept free, my wife and I felt the seats were more comfortable and the legroom slightly better. Service was good on board and the meal was very tasty (we chose the beef cheeks). All was good until we landed at Heathrow! Although we passed through passport control without delay, once we were at the designated baggage reclaim, we just waited and waited! After an hour and ten minutes I went to the BA baggage counter to ask what was going on. They seemed unaware of an issue, but said they would find out! Over the next hour or so various other passengers also requested information and despite various announcements and a list of different excuses it was almost 2½ hours before the bags finally arrived. Frustrating to say the least. I subsequently complained to BA, but after 4 weeks there has been no explanation just the automated message from customer services ‘we are experiencing exceptionally high volumes’.

" The customer services (call centres etc) are atrocious and sometimes callous. They just don’t care. Long waits to speak to anybody, who then have no power to actually solve anything, and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway. If the flights are cancelled (as were my original ones) you’re really left on your own and nobody cares. The onboard services are so-so but for short haul it’s now “semi-low cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect. This time we were given a bottle of water and a (very) small snack, whilst anything else had to be paid for. And yet on some other flights apparently you have to pre-order any additional food. It’s confusing, which makes it not dependable. Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins, leading to long boarding delays. Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well . The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight (contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off ) so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place. Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them.

"   I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years. Having noted the ratings given, frankly, I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service. In a nutshell, BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation. This fact was hammered home on my return leg, which was not in Club Europe. Quite alarmingly, BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its ""Business Class"" seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency. I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen. Short-haul business (Club Europe) is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefits. While cabin crew service is excellent, the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices, etc. places them a million 'air'miles behind competing airlines, such as Qatar, Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality. BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers - really? I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name ""Budget Airways"" The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer care/appreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip. Both flights were around 4 hours in duration, on the same day.

"  Flew with BA to Punta Cana. Took the trouble to reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights. On boarding at Gatwick, realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reserving. Apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason. The crew said there was nothing they could do (although of course they could just have swapped us with the couple using our seats). We were told to claim a refund on return home.

"   They downgraded me from business to premium economy. They took three months to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 AUD.

The downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them - I need to lie down.

"   The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage, there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was. Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board, only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasn't allowed yet. The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious. The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company. Service was slow, and as usual, choices of food to purchase ran out before they'd reached row 24. I requested a cup of tea which never appeared. Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels.

"  Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond.

"  BA standards continue to decline every time I fly with them. This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive.

Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight.

" I had a flight from Miami, Florida to Dublin, Ireland, via London's Heathrow airport. The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow. The total delay was roughly an hour, but it was enough to make our connection a challenge, where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin. When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked. Given the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight.

Given the other feedback on this site, it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment.",I had a flight from Miami Florida to Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow The total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin When we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed This was twenty minutes prior to departure time They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked Given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed We then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to Londons City Airport The cab fare was roughly 500 When I filed a claim with British Airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight The person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure I will never fly this awful airline again Given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,,"[('flight', 'n'), ('Miami', 'n'), ('Florida', 'n'), ('Dublin', 'n'), ('Ireland', 'n'), ('via', None), ('Londons', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('airport', None), ('outbound', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Miami', 'n'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('gate', 'n'), ('occupied', 'v'), ('arrived', 'v'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('total', 'a'), ('delay', 'n'), ('roughly', 'r'), ('hour', 'n'), ('enough', 'a'), ('make', 'v'), ('connection', 'n'), ('challenge', 'n'), ('73', None), ('minutes', 'n'), ('original', 'a'), ('arrival', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('departure', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('Dublin', 'n'), ('headed', 'v'), ('connection', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('stopped', 'v'), ('security', 'n'), ('personnel', 'n'), ('checkpoint', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('us', None), ('gate', 'n'), ('connection', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('already', 'r'), ('closed', 'v'), ('twenty', 'a'), ('minutes', 'n'), ('prior', 'r'), ('departure', 'v'), ('time', 'n'), ('ushered', 'v'), ('us', None), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('rebooked', 'v'), ('Given', 'n'), ('busy', 'a'), ('weekend', 'n'), ('travel', 'n'), ('rebooked', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('different', 'a'), ('airport', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('cost', 'n'), ('get', 'v'), ('would', None), ('reimbursed', 'v'), ('waited', 'v'), ('3', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('luggage', 'n'), ('took', 'v'), ('cab', 'n'), ('Londons', 'n'), ('City', 'n'), ('Airport', 'n'), ('cab', 'n'), ('fare', 'n'), ('roughly', 'r'), ('500', None), ('filed', 'v'), ('claim', 'n'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('refused', 'v'), ('claim', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('plenty', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('make', 'v'), ('connecting', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('therefore', 'n'), ('denied', 'v'), ('claim', 'n'), ('reimbursed', 'v'), ('cab', 'n'), ('fare', 'n'), ('explained', 'v'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('employees', 'n'), ('ushered', 'v'), ('us', None), ('rebook', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('despite', None), ('20', None), ('minute', 'n'), ('timeframe', 'n'), ('make', 'v'), ('connecting', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('person', 'n'), ('rebooked', 'v'), ('us', None), ('told', 'v'), ('us', None), ('policy', 'n'), ('close', 'v'), ('gate', 'n'), ('20', None), ('minutes', 'n'), ('prior', 'r'), ('departure', 'n'), ('never', 'r'), ('fly', 'v'), ('awful', 'a'), ('airline', 'n'), ('Given', 'n'), ('feedback', 'n'), ('site', 'n'), ('appears', 'v'), ('overwhelming', 'a'), ('sentiment', 'n')]",flight Miami Florida Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport outbound flight Miami delay delay gate occupy arrive Heathrow total delay roughly hour enough make connection challenge 73 minute original arrival time departure time Dublin head connection flight stop security personnel checkpoint tell we gate connection flight already close twenty minute prior departure time usher we customer service rebooke give busy weekend travel rebooke flight different airport tell cost get would reimburse wait 3 hour luggage take cab Londons City Airport cab fare roughly 500 file claim British Airways refuse claim tell plenty time make connect flight therefore deny claim reimburse cab fare explain British Airways employee usher we rebook flight despite 20 minute timeframe make connect flight person rebooke we tell we policy close gate 20 minute prior departure never fly awful airline give feedback site appear overwhelming sentiment,-0.6718,Negative
  We started our day with BA in Prague. The flight actually left on time! I came to find out that’s very unusual. We purchased business class seats. As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class. All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class. Horrible flight. In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served. Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn’t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything. The power outlet didn’t work. There was no internet the entire flight. The overhead luggage bin was too heavy. I almost got a hernia having to close it. This is a horrible airline. I’ll never fly with them again.

  I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer. The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate. I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst. It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff.

"  Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London, just before take off, we were on the runway, the pilot came on to announce an engine problem. After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day. Now it's 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that. So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone. I feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information",Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London just before take off

" Worst BA experience. I was supposed to fly out to Italy on 7 September 2023. I arrived at OR Tambo International airport ready to check my bags in (I already checked-in online the previous evening so I had my boarding pass ready). At the counter I was told that I had been off-loaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelled. No information was sent regarding this beforehand. The team at the check-in counter tried to get me on another flight that evening, but there were no flights available. They did manage to get me another flight the following evening with Lufthansa to Italy via Frankfurt. However, I did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than I was supposed to. Upon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order, which they assured me is correct. I have to fly back to South Africa on 18 September and upon checking my booking information I noticed on my BA account that my first flight (Milan to London) is just missing from my booking. My connecting from London to Johannesburg is still there. After spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances, the moment I proceed to give my booking reference number, my call gets dropped. Currently it seems like I will be arriving at the airport again on Monday without a flight.",Worst BA experience I was supposed to fly out to Italy on 7 September 2023 I arrived at OR Tambo International airport ready to check my bags in I already checkedin online the previous evening so I had my boarding pass ready At the counter I was told that I had been offloaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelled No information was sent regarding this beforehand The team at the checkin counter tried to get me on another flight that evening but there were no flights available They did manage to get me another flight the following evening with Lufthansa to Italy via Frankfurt However I did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than I was supposed to Upon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order which they assured me is correct I have to fly back to South Africa on 18 September and upon checking my booking information I noticed on my BA account that my first flight Milan to London is just missing from my booking My connecting from London to Johannesburg is still there After spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances the moment I proceed to give my booking reference number my call gets dropped Currently it seems like I will be arriving at the airport again on Monday without a flight,,"[('Worst', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('experience', 'n'), ('supposed', 'v'), ('fly', 'v'), ('Italy', 'n'), ('7', None), ('September', 'n'), ('2023', None), ('arrived', 'v'), ('Tambo', 'n'), ('International', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('ready', 'n'), ('check', 'v'), ('bags', 'n'), ('already', 'r'), ('checkedin', 'v'), ('online', 'v'), ('previous', 'a'), ('evening', 'n'), ('boarding', 'a'), ('pass', 'n'), ('ready', 'n'), ('counter', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('offloaded', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('connecting', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('cancelled', 'v'), ('information', 'n'), ('sent', 'v'), ('regarding', 'v'), ('beforehand', 'n'), ('team', 'n'), ('checkin', 'n'), ('counter', 'n'), ('tried', 'v'), ('get', 'v'), ('another', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('evening', 'v'), ('flights', 'n'), ('available', 'a'), ('manage', 'v'), ('get', 'v'), ('another', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('following', 'v'), ('evening', 'n'), ('Lufthansa', 'n'), ('Italy', 'n'), ('via', None), ('Frankfurt', 'n'), ('However', 'r'), ('miss', 'v'), ('first', 'a'), ('part', 'n'), ('trip', 'n'), ('arrived', 'v'), ('day', 'n'), ('half', 'n'), ('later', 'r'), ('supposed', 'v'), ('Upon', None), ('moving', 'v'), ('flights', 'n'), ('ask', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('whether', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('back', 'r'), ('still', 'r'), ('valid', 'a'), ('everything', 'n'), ('order', 'n'), ('assured', 'v'), ('correct', 'a'), ('fly', 'v'), ('back', 'r'), ('South', 'n'), ('Africa', 'n'), ('18', None), ('September', 'n'), ('upon', None), ('checking', 'v'), ('booking', 'v'), ('information', 'n'), ('noticed', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('account', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Milan', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('missing', 'v'), ('booking', 'v'), ('connecting', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('Johannesburg', 'n'), ('still', 'r'), ('spending', 'v'), ('entire', 'a'), ('morning', 'n'), ('customer', 'n'), ('helpline', 'n'), ('two', None), ('different', 'a'), ('operators', 'n'), ('picked', 'v'), ('instances', 'n'), ('moment', 'n'), ('proceed', 'v'), ('give', 'v'), ('booking', 'v'), ('reference', 'n'), ('number', 'n'), ('call', 'a'), ('gets', 'v'), ('dropped', 'v'), ('Currently', 'n'), ('seems', 'v'), ('like', None), ('arriving', 'v'), ('airport', 'n'), ('Monday', 'n'), ('without', None), ('flight', 'n')]",bad BA experience suppose fly Italy 7 September 2023 arrive Tambo International airport ready check bag already checkedin online previous evening boarding pass ready counter tell offload flight connect flight cancel information send regard beforehand team checkin counter try get another flight evening flight available manage get another flight follow evening Lufthansa Italy via Frankfurt however miss first part trip arrive day half later suppose upon move flight ask BA staff whether flight back still valid everything order assure correct fly back South Africa 18 September upon check book information notice BA account first flight Milan London miss booking connect London Johannesburg still spend entire morning customer helpline two different operator pick instance moment proceed give booking reference number call gets drop currently seem like arrive airport Monday without flight,0.1027,Neutral
"  My daughter and I were denied boarding on our business class flight from Madrid to Heathrow in March 25, 2023, the first leg on our return flight to Victoria, Canada. No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid, who said they were only agents and told us to call British Airways. We were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports. After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone, but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights. Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways. Incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3. This was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. Even though these were Business Class tickets. Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. This nine day delay was a major problem for us. I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. Further, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. After our return I began the British Airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. I received an email reply and a case reference number. And then nothing. I sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. It is now months later, and still I have not heard from British Airways. This is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decades. I am a very patient person and this is the first time I have commented on this type of forum.

"  British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London!

" London Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flights.

" Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777-200. This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats. They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I've seen on airplanes. BA's new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivals. The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasn't an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn't at full capacity. There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more. The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India. The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time. In summary: British Airways provides a good, but not spectacular, Business Class product.",Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777200 This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats They are comfortable there is enough storage space around the cubicle and the monitor screen is among the larger ones Ive seen on airplanes BAs new Club Suites are said to be far superior competing with the best Bclass rivals The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasnt an issue on this flight since the premier section wasnt at full capacity There was WiFi on board fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth The food was alright and no more The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 110 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time In summary British Airways provides a good but not spectacular Business Class product,,"[('Mumbai', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('Business', 'n'), ('Class', 'n'), ('ageing', 'v'), ('B777200', 'n'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('featured', 'v'), ('older', 'a'), ('Club', 'n'), ('World', 'n'), ('flatbed', 'v'), ('seats', 'n'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('enough', 'a'), ('storage', 'n'), ('space', 'n'), ('around', None), ('cubicle', 'n'), ('monitor', 'n'), ('screen', 'n'), ('among', None), ('larger', 'a'), ('ones', 'n'), ('Ive', 'n'), ('seen', 'v'), ('airplanes', 'n'), ('BAs', 'n'), ('new', 'a'), ('Club', 'n'), ('Suites', 'n'), ('said', 'v'), ('far', 'r'), ('superior', 'a'), ('competing', 'v'), ('best', 'a'), ('Bclass', 'n'), ('rivals', 'v'), ('entire', 'a'), ('Business', 'n'), ('Class', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('2', None), ('washrooms', 'n'), ('wasnt', 'v'), ('issue', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('since', None), ('premier', 'n'), ('section', 'n'), ('wasnt', 'n'), ('full', 'a'), ('capacity', 'n'), ('WiFi', 'n'), ('board', 'n'), ('fast', 'r'), ('enough', 'r'), ('even', 'r'), ('send', 'v'), ('videos', 'n'), ('via', None), ('messaging', 'v'), ('apps', 'a'), ('Service', 'n'), ('onboard', 'n'), ('competent', 'a'), ('staff', 'n'), ('lacked', 'v'), ('warmth', None), ('food', 'n'), ('alright', 'v'), ('biggest', 'a'), ('plus', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('gets', 'v'), ('Bombay', 'n'), ('110', None), ('pm', 'n'), ('afternoon', 'n'), ('instead', 'r'), ('ungodly', 'a'), ('early', 'a'), ('morning', 'n'), ('hours', 'n'), ('international', 'a'), ('flights', 'n'), ('take', 'v'), ('India', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('experience', 'n'), ('far', 'r'), ('pleasant', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('summary', 'a'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('provides', 'v'), ('good', 'a'), ('spectacular', 'a'), ('Business', 'n'), ('Class', 'n'), ('product', 'n')]",Mumbai London Heathrow Business Class ageing b777200 aircraft feature old Club World flatbe seat comfortable enough storage space around cubicle monitor screen among large one I ve see airplane bas new Club Suites say far superior compete good Bclass rival entire business Class cabin 2 washroom be not issue flight since premier section be not full capacity WiFi board fast enough even send video via message app Service onboard competent staff lack warmth food alright big plus flight get Bombay 110 pm afternoon instead ungodly early morning hour international flight take India airport experience far pleasant time summary British Airways provide good spectacular Business Class product,0.9633,Positive

  Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable. How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. Are there any redeeming features - the answer is no. If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague.,Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,,"[('Flying', 'v'), ('A380', 'n'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('pleasure', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('made', 'v'), ('disaster', 'n'), ('worst', 'a'), ('seating', 'n'), ('configuration', 'n'), ('imaginable', 'a'), ('could', None), ('sane', 'a'), ('person', 'n'), ('could', None), ('jam', 'v'), ('many', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), ('limited', 'a'), ('space', 'n'), ('expect', 'a'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('happy', 'a'), ('Seats', 'n'), ('narrower', 'a'), ('economy', 'n'), ('airlines', 'n'), ('must', None), ('face', 'v'), ('another', None), ('person', 'n'), ('plastic', 'a'), ('screen', 'n'), ('raised', 'v'), ('Tv', 'n'), ('screens', 'n'), ('size', 'n'), ('medium', 'n'), ('sized', 'v'), ('tablet', 'n'), ('controls', 'n'), ('behind', None), ('head', 'n'), ('sitting', 'a'), ('position', 'n'), ('put', 'v'), ('anything', 'n'), ('except', None), ('one', None), ('small', 'a'), ('pull', 'v'), ('draw', 'n'), ('ground', 'n'), ('level', 'n'), ('reached', 'v'), ('seated', 'v'), ('accessed', 'v'), ('sleeping', 'v'), ('window', 'n'), ('seats', 'n'), ('middle', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), ('accessed', 'v'), ('jump', 'v'), ('passenger', 'n'), ('aisle', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('seats', 'n'), ('low', 'a'), ('hard', 'a'), ('elderly', 'a'), ('get', 'v'), ('whole', 'a'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('set', 'v'), ('sick', 'a'), ('joke', 'n'), ('Eating', 'n'), ('difficult', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('close', 'r'), ('enough', 'r'), ('table', 'n'), ('tables', 'n'), ('flimsy', 'a'), ('drinks', 'n'), ('fall', 'v'), ('redeeming', 'n'), ('features', 'v'), ('answer', 'n'), ('like', 'v'), ('little', 'a'), ('comfort', 'n'), ('avoid', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('like', None), ('plague', 'n')]",fly a380 business class pleasure BA make disaster worst seat configuration imaginable could sane person could jam many seat limited space expect passenger happy seat narrow economy airline must face another person plastic screen raise Tv screen size medium sized tablet control behind head sit position put anything except one small pull draw ground level reach seat access sleep window seat middle seat access jump passenger aisle seat seat low hard elderly get whole business class set sick joke eat difficult seat close enough table table flimsy drink fall redeem feature answer like little comfort avoid BA like plague,-0.5291,Negative
"  British Airways absolutely does not care. My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight, full flight and it was quite awful. After enquiring at LAX check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can do. Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed, with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice. Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that. No water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore it. I used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier.

"  My recent experience with British Airways was not just horrendous, it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their part. I arrived at JFK ready for my flight to Malaga, only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice. After a draining 2-hour altercation, I was finally placed on a different flight. The nightmare continued when I landed in Malaga sans luggage, containing essentials for my son's wedding. Thirty agonizing hours later, the bags showed up—but my brand-new iPad and a special watch for my nephew were missing. The items weren't merely valuable; they had emotional significance, which made the loss even more gut-wrenching. You'd think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors.  Despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit. Their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous. Their response was, in essence, ""It's your fault for trusting us with your belongings."" This isn't just poor customer service; it's a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility. British Airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to. If you have any respect for your time, belongings, and emotional well-being, avoid British Airways at all costs. They not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err, leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence.",My recent experience with British Airways was not just horrendous it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their part I arrived at JFK ready for my flight to Malaga only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice After a draining 2hour altercation I was finally placed on a different flight The nightmare continued when I landed in Malaga sans luggage containing essentials for my sons wedding Thirty agonizing hours later the bags showed upbut my brandnew iPad and a special watch for my nephew were missing The items werent merely valuable they had emotional significance which made the loss even more gutwrenching Youd think a reputable airline would make amends for such errors Despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit Their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous Their response was in essence Its your fault for trusting us with your belongings This isnt just poor customer service its a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility British Airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to If you have any respect for your time belongings and emotional wellbeing avoid British Airways at all costs They not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence,,"[('recent', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('horrendous', 'a'), ('utter', 'a'), ('abdication', 'n'), ('responsibility', 'n'), ('part', 'n'), ('arrived', 'v'), ('JFK', 'n'), ('ready', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Malaga', 'n'), ('find', 'v'), ('cancelled', 'v'), ('zero', None), ('notice', 'n'), ('draining', 'v'), ('2hour', None), ('altercation', 'n'), ('finally', 'r'), ('placed', 'v'), ('different', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('nightmare', 'n'), ('continued', 'v'), ('landed', 'v'), ('Malaga', 'n'), ('sans', 'n'), ('luggage', 'v'), ('containing', 'v'), ('essentials', 'n'), ('sons', 'n'), ('wedding', 'v'), ('Thirty', 'n'), ('agonizing', 'n'), ('hours', 'n'), ('later', 'r'), ('bags', 'n'), ('showed', 'v'), ('upbut', 'a'), ('brandnew', 'a'), ('iPad', 'n'), ('special', 'a'), ('watch', 'n'), ('nephew', 'n'), ('missing', 'v'), ('items', 'n'), ('werent', 'v'), ('merely', 'r'), ('valuable', 'a'), ('emotional', 'a'), ('significance', 'n'), ('made', 'v'), ('loss', 'n'), ('even', 'r'), ('gutwrenching', 'a'), ('Youd', 'n'), ('think', 'v'), ('reputable', 'a'), ('airline', 'n'), ('would', None), ('make', 'v'), ('amends', 'n'), ('errors', 'n'), ('Despite', None), ('clear', 'a'), ('mishandling', 'n'), ('baggage', 'n'), ('team', 'n'), ('refused', 'v'), ('offer', 'v'), ('reimbursement', 'n'), ('even', 'r'), ('modest', 'a'), ('amount', 'n'), ('airline', 'n'), ('credit', 'n'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('ineffective', 'a'), ('also', 'r'), ('astonishingly', 'r'), ('callous', 'a'), ('response', 'n'), ('essence', 'n'), ('fault', 'n'), ('trusting', 'v'), ('us', None), ('belongings', 'n'), ('isnt', 'n'), ('poor', 'a'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('complete', 'a'), ('disregard', 'n'), ('basic', 'a'), ('human', 'a'), ('decency', 'n'), ('responsibility', 'n'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('numerous', 'a'), ('opportunities', 'n'), ('right', 'v'), ('wrongs', 'n'), ('chose', 'v'), ('respect', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('belongings', 'n'), ('emotional', 'a'), ('wellbeing', 'n'), ('avoid', 'a'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('costs', 'n'), ('fail', 'v'), ('deliver', 'v'), ('promises', 'n'), ('also', 'r'), ('refuse', 'v'), ('make', 'v'), ('amends', 'n'), ('err', 'v'), ('leaving', 'v'), ('customers', 'n'), ('bear', 'v'), ('brunt', 'n'), ('incompetence', 'n')]",recent experience British Airways horrendous utter abdication responsibility part arrive JFK ready flight Malaga find cancel zero notice drain 2hour altercation finally place different flight nightmare continue land Malaga sans luggage contain essential son wed thirty agonizing hour later bag show upbut brandnew iPad special watch nephew miss item be not merely valuable emotional significance make loss even gutwrenche You d think reputable airline would make amend error despite clear mishandle baggage team refuse offer reimbursement even modest amount airline credit customer service ineffective also astonishingly callous response essence fault trust we belonging be not poor customer service complete disregard basic human decency responsibility British Airways numerous opportunity right wrong choose respect time belonging emotional wellbeing avoid British Airways cost fail deliver promise also refuse make amend err leave customer bear brunt incompetence,-0.9496,Negative
"  This is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to Italy. Our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us, coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us (9 and 12 days)! Our departure dates: June 19, 2023 - Flight BA 294, Chicago to London. June 20 rebooked by BA on BA 546, London to Rome. All flights were late. On arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport. Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome. BA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife's. I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour. We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times. After 5 days, BA stated that they found my wife's bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4” easily visible tags and bright pink bows. Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable. Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago. All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago. On July 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries, also for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago. After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BA. We are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA’s errors. I can honestly say that the times I was able to reach a human being, they were all courteous and attempted to help, but appeared at a loss.

"  I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe. We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour! After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight. No effort to apologise. We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient.

"  I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go through security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won’t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don’t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.",I arrived at the airport

" When on our way to Heathrow Airport and merely 2 and a half hours before the scheduled departure, we received an SMS stating that our flight to Johannesburg had been canceled an no reason given. We were then put on the same flight one day later with no other choice offered. As we were already at the airport, we proceeded to check in to ask what caused the cancellation (apparently the pilot was sick and there was nobody available on standby) and what we could do about it. The Business Class check-in desk assistant, was unsympathetic and told us we could not check in our bags for the following day. We found someone else who told us we could check them in 24 hrs prior to departure, so we waited at the airport an further 2 hours and checked them in, after which we went back home.

" Nice flight, good crew, very good seat, food was what you would expect. The aircraft had the new style Business Class seats/suite the actual plane as not new in any since of the word.

The video system worked great and had plenty of content. The headphones however were cheap and didn't feel or work particular good. The layout on this 773 had a lot of business class seats, a lot!

"  My family flew from Washington to London on a British Airways A380, we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee. Our flight was unfortunately delayed by 2 hrs from 2245 to 0120 causing us to miss a connection from Gatwick to Turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport. Onboard I sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff. In flight entertainment system didn’t work very well, the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use, it could use updating. The food for dinner was decent, they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards. The seat was pretty comfortable, and the flight was smooth. After we missed our connection and we’re stuck behind security for 2 hrs waiting for escorts, they rebooked us on a flight from Heathrow to Milan the next day, gave us free bus tickets to Heathrow, gave us a free hotel room, and gave us Dinner and Breakfast vouchers.

  I had the most fantastic BA Flight today. The cabin crew in my seat zone 6D were of the best I have experienced. Although the 777 had the old style rear/front seating - it was comfortable and felt open and spacious. BA have done great things with the menu - it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre-arrival meal into HKG at 1730PM local time having left London at 2200 the night before. The dinner offering was equally ample and delicious. The inflight entertainment had a great collection of TV and current films and the inflight map was first rate. Previously not a huge BA fan - but after this 12 hour flight I could only recommend it without reserve. I flew the new BA suite in J class on a recent Delhi to London flight and enjoyed that product (although I felt it slightly more cramped ) but I think BA have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way.

" Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",Terrible Experience with British Airways I booked a flight with BA to

" I chose British Airways especially because I was going to travel with my niece and nephew, and wanted everything to work well. What a disaster! First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. I also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. Then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. They just told us to wait. Finally we could access the plane. After 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airport. No information was provided, no solutions were offered. We had to seat in the last raw (when I had paid to seat on the first half of the plane). No money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given. I also had pre-purchased food and they couldn’t provide the service. All in all, terrible.

" A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.",A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone My partner and I recently started

BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own.

"  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each.

The team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment.

"  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA.

"  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund.

"  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well.

  This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening.

"  Beware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest. They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right.

It was dark at 5am. It was hard to see mobile phone screen. I’m still jet lagged. Only option was to LHR at 9.20am. Tried calling. No one there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change! It was the next day! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Nope. I better call to say hey sorry I screwed up. Your flight is not going to work for me. I don’t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don’t want to waste one night in London. Called.

She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff.

"  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay.

After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there.

" I went through three flights to reach my destination. All of my BA flights without exception were delayed, both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent. What's not understandable is that they weren't prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so I ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since BA didn't communicate properly with them. I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints.

"  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again.

" Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU.

". The BA first lounge at Terminal 5 was a  zoo at 2pm, dirty tables and used tableware everywhere. Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class.

" Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. I was glad it was only a two hour flight. I really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money",Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant I paid over 300 for a business class round trip I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded Being 630 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate B36 and waited there for 40 mins Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C seat 2B was blocked out which acted as an additional table There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight The inflight magazine is no longer available There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and nonexistent at other times I was glad it was only a two hour flight I really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money,,"[('Paid', 'v'), ('quick', 'a'), ('visit', 'n'), ('Nice', 'n'), ('yesterday', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('Decided', 'v'), ('go', 'v'), ('Business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('since', None), ('last', 'a'), ('short', 'a'), ('haul', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Economy', 'n'), ('real', 'a'), ('crush', 'n'), ('rather', 'r'), ('unpleasant', 'a'), ('paid', 'v'), ('300', None), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('round', 'n'), ('trip', 'n'), ('went', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('lounge', 'n'), ('Terminal', 'n'), ('5', None), ('crowded', 'a'), ('630', None), ('morning', 'n'), ('decided', 'v'), ('drink', 'n'), ('stuck', 'n'), ('breakfast', 'n'), ('offering', 'v'), ('cooked', 'a'), ('options', 'n'), ('look', 'v'), ('appealing', 'v'), ('fresh', 'a'), ('fruit', 'n'), ('selection', 'n'), ('enjoyable', 'a'), ('subsequently', 'r'), ('discovered', 'v'), ('much', 'a'), ('nicer', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('lounge', 'n'), ('closer', 'n'), ('gate', 'n'), ('B36', 'n'), ('waited', 'v'), ('40', None), ('mins', 'n'), ('Boarding', 'n'), ('efficient', 'a'), ('got', 'v'), ('seated', 'v'), ('2A', None), ('2C', None), ('seat', 'n'), ('2B', None), ('blocked', 'v'), ('acted', 'v'), ('additional', 'a'), ('table', 'n'), ('seem', 'v'), ('difference', 'n'), ('width', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('cramped', 'a'), ('seating', 'n'), ('Economy', 'n'), ('may', None), ('additional', 'a'), ('inch', 'n'), ('leg', 'a'), ('room', 'n'), ('think', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('trying', 'v'), ('outdo', 'v'), ('EasyJet', 'n'), ('terms', 'n'), ('frills', 'n'), ('would', None), ('cost', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('much', 'r'), ('supply', 'v'), ('Business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('complimentary', 'a'), ('newspaper', 'n'), ('read', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('inflight', 'a'), ('magazine', 'n'), ('longer', 'r'), ('available', 'a'), ('screens', 'n'), ('zero', 'n'), ('terms', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('entertainment', 'n'), ('inflight', 'n'), ('WiFi', 'n'), ('flaky', 'v'), ('best', 'a'), ('nonexistent', 'n'), ('times', 'n'), ('glad', 'v'), ('two', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('really', 'r'), ('think', 'v'), ('fare', 'n'), ('paid', 'v'), ('worth', 'a'), ('money', 'n')]",pay quick visit Nice yesterday Heathrow decide go business class since last short haul flight Economy real crush rather unpleasant pay 300 business class round trip go BA lounge Terminal 5 crowd 630 morning decide drink stick breakfast offer cook option look appeal fresh fruit selection enjoyable subsequently discover much nice BA lounge close gate B36 wait 40 min Boarding efficient get seat 2A 2C seat 2B block act additional table seem difference width seat cramp seat Economy may additional inch leg room think BA try outdo EasyJet term frill would cost BA much supply business class passenger complimentary newspaper read flight inflight magazine long available screen zero term flight entertainment inflight WiFi flaky good nonexistent time glad two hour flight really think fare pay worth money,0.9353,Positive

They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.

" Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.",Regarding the aircraft and seat The business class seats on this flight were pretty good All were of the suite type where

" I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me. I am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the lack of customer service.",I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via

"  Food was lousy. Who ever is planning the Asian Hindu Vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes. The snack was also lousy. It took us 2 hours just to go from T5 to T3 and clear security check. The place was chaotic.

  Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.,Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways So many issues with getting from one destination to the other Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic we are sorry email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe 50 on a 600 flight Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldnt even address one single issue expressed to them It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss,,"[('Worst', 'n'), ('experience', 'n'), ('life', 'n'), ('trying', 'v'), ('deal', 'v'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('many', 'a'), ('issues', 'n'), ('getting', 'v'), ('one', None), ('destination', 'n'), ('absolutely', 'r'), ('horrible', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('trying', 'v'), ('get', 'v'), ('answers', 'n'), ('reach', 'v'), ('anyone', 'n'), ('capable', 'a'), ('helping', 'v'), ('navigate', 'a'), ('uncertainties', 'n'), ('wrote', 'v'), ('formal', 'a'), ('complaint', 'n'), ('requesting', 'v'), ('type', 'n'), ('refund', 'n'), ('received', 'v'), ('generic', 'a'), ('sorry', 'a'), ('email', 'n'), ('5000', None), ('avios', 'n'), ('attached', 'v'), ('equivalent', 'a'), ('maybe', 'r'), ('50', None), ('600', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('Needless', 'n'), ('say', 'v'), ('go', 'v'), ('waste', 'v'), ('refuse', 'v'), ('fly', 'v'), ('untrustworthy', 'a'), ('incompetent', 'n'), ('unorganized', 'a'), ('airline', 'n'), ('couldnt', 'v'), ('even', 'r'), ('address', 'a'), ('one', None), ('single', 'a'), ('issue', 'n'), ('expressed', 'v'), ('equivalent', 'a'), ('handing', 'v'), ('band', 'n'), ('aid', 'n'), ('slapping', 'v'), ('face', 'n'), ('say', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('smooth', 'r'), ('onboard', 'a'), ('staff', 'n'), ('kind', 'n'), ('attentive', 'v'), ('frustrating', 'a'), ('thing', 'n'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('trained', 'v'), ('give', 'v'), ('runaround', 'n'), ('heavily', 'r'), ('point', 'n'), ('exhaustion', 'n'), ('give', 'v'), ('trying', 'v'), ('take', 'v'), ('loss', 'n')]",bad experience life try deal customer service British Airways many issue get one destination absolutely horrible time try get answer reach anyone capable help navigate uncertainty write formal complaint request type refund receive generic sorry email 5000 avio attach equivalent maybe 50 600 flight Needless say go waste refuse fly untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline could not even address one single issue express equivalent handing band aid slapping face say flight smooth onboard staff kind attentive frustrating thing customer service train give runaround heavily point exhaustion give try take loss,-0.9531,Negative
"  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.

"  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays.

"  I wouldn't recommend British Airways at all. I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF.

"  Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3?

The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many years. On the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimal.

" Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through. Overall a very solid experience in economy. Significantly better than it used to be.",Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised Once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical BA style The seat was quite comfortable It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didnt suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable The IFE is excellent responsive and good quality There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I dont think 1799 for full flight is bad value You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging Cabin crew were very good Friendly and efficient Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasnt really enough Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick it felt like it was 3am even though it was 630pm No queues or waiting at all Even the baggage was super quick at coming through Overall a very solid experience in economy Significantly better than it used to be,,"[('Boarding', 'v'), ('Mumbai', 'n'), ('chaotic', 'a'), ('badly', 'r'), ('organised', 'v'), ('board', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('announcements', 'n'), ('professional', 'a'), ('relaxed', 'n'), ('informative', 'a'), ('typical', 'a'), ('BA', 'n'), ('style', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('quite', 'r'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('refurbished', 'v'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('padding', 'n'), ('materials', 'n'), ('quite', 'r'), ('good', 'a'), ('lucky', 'a'), ('middle', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('empty', 'a'), ('didnt', 'v'), ('suffer', 'v'), ('new', 'a'), ('narrow', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('think', 'v'), ('would', None), ('made', 'v'), ('lot', 'n'), ('less', 'r'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('IFE', 'n'), ('excellent', 'a'), ('responsive', 'a'), ('good', 'a'), ('quality', 'n'), ('enormous', 'a'), ('selection', 'n'), ('TV', 'n'), ('movies', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('number', 'n'), ('games', 'n'), ('WIFI', 'n'), ('also', 'r'), ('good', 'a'), ('quite', 'r'), ('Netflix', 'a'), ('quality', 'n'), ('still', 'r'), ('reasonable', 'a'), ('dont', 'v'), ('think', 'v'), ('1799', None), ('full', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('bad', 'a'), ('value', 'n'), ('pay', 'v'), ('less', 'a'), ('want', 'v'), ('short', 'a'), ('term', 'n'), ('simple', 'a'), ('messaging', 'v'), ('Cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('Friendly', 'n'), ('efficient', 'a'), ('Catering', 'n'), ('reasonable', 'a'), ('although', None), ('near', 'a'), ('10hr', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('small', 'a'), ('tasty', 'a'), ('pastry', 'n'), ('second', 'a'), ('meal', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('wasnt', 'v'), ('really', 'r'), ('enough', 'a'), ('Landing', 'n'), ('processing', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('astonishingly', 'r'), ('quick', 'a'), ('felt', 'v'), ('like', None), ('3am', None), ('even', 'r'), ('though', None), ('630pm', None), ('queues', 'n'), ('waiting', 'v'), ('Even', 'r'), ('baggage', 'n'), ('super', 'a'), ('quick', 'n'), ('coming', 'v'), ('Overall', 'n'), ('solid', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('economy', 'n'), ('Significantly', 'r'), ('better', 'r'), ('used', 'v')]",Boarding Mumbai chaotic badly organise board crew announcement professional relaxed informative typical BA style seat quite comfortable refurbish aircraft padding material quite good lucky middle seat empty do not suffer new narrow seat think would made lot less comfortable IFE excellent responsive good quality enormous selection tv movie good number game WIFI also good quite netflix quality still reasonable do not think 1799 full flight bad value pay less want short term simple message Cabin crew good friendly efficient Catering reasonable although near 10hr flight small tasty pastry second meal service be not really enough landing processing Heathrow astonishingly quick feel like 3 am even though 630pm queue wait even baggage super quick come overall solid experience economy significantly well use,0.9907,Positive
" Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam?

"  Very poor service, very frustrating. Firstly my flight to LHR was cancelled on 16 Mar23, while I got a text message to inform me, the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam. Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left.

" I was meant to fly in January to Algeria. I paid over £300 for the ticket. Just a few days before I was meant to fly, my wife broke her foot. I had to then rebook it in March and pay another £100. I called British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March and I told them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not well. They told me that I don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. However, they never sent me the ticket. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only). I found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money I previously paid. Each time I call them, they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay £360.

"  I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant.

Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal.

" First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price.

The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight.

"  Booked a flight return flight between London and Munich for 3/11 to 3/17 in December. The return flight was cancelled and re-booked from 3/17 to 3/12. British Airways only notified me of the first change, but not the second. Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions. Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone.

"  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option.

"  We were flying World Traveller Plus their Premium service. What it was not was Premium. We have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly Premium most times. BA's premium is the worst I have come across. The flight from Heathrow to JFK was just ok, the flight back was in a plane that should not be used. Old, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the button. BA needs to look at the Premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs. They have fallen far behind their competitors, they were once my preferred airline but now I try and avoid at all costs.

  This was literally one of the worst experiences. I haven’t been to an airport since. It began in Orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for 6 hours. Poor customer service and just ignored at times. Then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags. Even though I booked through to Dublin. Another 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight. Another hour later I was handed a card with a number and told to ring it. I was cut off three times and told I wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available. Just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for Christmas and missed an engagement party.,This was literally one of the worst experiences I havent been to an airport since It began in Orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for 6 hours Poor customer service and just ignored at times Then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags Even though I booked through to Dublin Another 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight Another hour later I was handed a card with a number and told to ring it I was cut off three times and told I wouldnt be able to get home that day despite several flights being available Just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for Christmas and missed an engagement party,,"[('literally', 'r'), ('one', None), ('worst', 'a'), ('experiences', 'n'), ('havent', 'v'), ('airport', 'n'), ('since', None), ('began', 'v'), ('Orlando', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('back', 'r'), ('flight', 'n'), ('plan', 'n'), ('system', 'n'), ('went', 'v'), ('stuck', 'v'), ('tarmac', 'n'), ('6', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('Poor', 'n'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('ignored', 'v'), ('times', 'n'), ('missed', 'v'), ('connecting', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('leave', 'v'), ('baggage', 'n'), ('area', 'n'), ('without', None), ('bags', 'n'), ('Even', 'r'), ('though', None), ('booked', 'v'), ('Dublin', 'n'), ('Another', None), ('4', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('bags', 'n'), ('lost', 'v'), ('continue', 'v'), ('desk', 'n'), ('book', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Another', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('later', 'r'), ('handed', 'v'), ('card', 'n'), ('number', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('ring', 'v'), ('cut', 'v'), ('three', None), ('times', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('wouldnt', 'v'), ('able', 'a'), ('get', 'v'), ('home', 'n'), ('day', 'n'), ('despite', None), ('several', 'a'), ('flights', 'n'), ('available', 'a'), ('booked', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('lost', 'v'), ('suit', 'n'), ('presents', 'n'), ('Christmas', 'n'), ('missed', 'v'), ('engagement', 'n'), ('party', 'n')]",literally one bad experience have not airport since begin Orlando fly back flight plan system go stuck tarmac 6 hour poor customer service ignore time miss connect flight tell leave baggage area without bag even though book Dublin another 4 hour tell bag lose continue desk book flight another hour later handed card number tell ring cut three time tell would not able get home day despite several flight available booked flight lose suit present Christmas miss engagement party,-0.9186,Negative
"  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.",The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come

I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone.

"  The incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany, and not BA's fault. O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance. It took around 40 minutes to find someone.

"  Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

"  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.",My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with

"  Not only my first flight in 17 years, but also my first time back to England for 17 years. I flew from PMI-LGW on 21/01/2023 and returned on 29/01/2023. Both Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage. British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available, they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - Total cost for both flights was €126 +/- Regular update information via email, seamless online seat allocation and check in. Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible. Immaculate aircraft, comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom (I'm 6'4"" tall) Cabin crew were polite, friendly and professional.

"  My husband and myself were flying to Madrid on the 3rd of February for a Legal matter and we had to be in Madrid by 13:00 pm. We had booked our flight and car with BA Holidays. Unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before, we got lost, and missed our 6:00 am flight to Madrid. I tried to stay calm, cold head and we went to British Airways to get help. The first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with BA Holidays, we didn't know that, she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn't do anything else, that we had to call that number. We called the number, which was asking us to call another  number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm, We went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anything. I did reach out to another staff , a lovely young lady called Althea. She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message that I had to call, and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line, modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 7.30 am. They didn't charge us for that, our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to Madrid. Without the support of the lovely Althea, her professionalism, her care for us, we would not have make it.

"  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder.

I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.

"  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).",As a Spanish born individual living in England I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades multiple times a year On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son

The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor.

"  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.

" Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height.

"  BA shuttle service across the UK is still surprisingly a good product. When compared with BA long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times.

" I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews. But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say.

  Paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

"  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for.

"  Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October.

"  BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience.

"  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward.

I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better.

I understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto my final flight. I filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where I received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was received. I made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and I should hear back within 24 hours. Finally the email with the tracking number was received on Tuesday night. I went online with the tracking number on Wednesday and it requested that I provide the same information that I had given them on the form at the airport. My luggage was finally delivered on Thursday afternoon.

"  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there.",British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be The checkin

"  When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better.

"  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami.

" This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle.

"  Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. The bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good!

Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing.

"  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight.

" Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered.

"  Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. All in, it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention.",Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380 Check in at T5 is poor most of their kiosks dont work well and staff have to be called Boarding was very poorly managed The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue Once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful They did their job very professionally and efficiently They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 75 hour flight The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight All in it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention,,"[('Evening', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('LHR', 'n'), ('IAD', 'n'), ('A380', 'n'), ('Check', 'n'), ('T5', 'n'), ('poor', 'a'), ('kiosks', 'n'), ('dont', 'n'), ('work', 'n'), ('well', 'r'), ('staff', 'n'), ('called', 'v'), ('Boarding', 'n'), ('poorly', 'r'), ('managed', 'v'), ('ground', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('overwhelmed', 'a'), ('full', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('struggling', 'v'), ('manage', 'v'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('gate', 'n'), ('small', 'a'), ('insufficient', 'a'), ('seating', 'v'), ('big', 'a'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('full', 'a'), ('left', 'v'), ('50', None), ('minutes', 'n'), ('late', 'r'), ('pilot', 'n'), ('kept', 'v'), ('us', None), ('informed', 'v'), ('issue', 'n'), ('airborne', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('started', 'v'), ('quite', 'r'), ('quickly', 'r'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('pleasant', 'a'), ('helpful', 'a'), ('job', 'n'), ('professionally', 'r'), ('efficiently', 'r'), ('answered', 'v'), ('call', 'n'), ('bells', 'v'), ('promptly', 'r'), ('nothing', 'n'), ('much', 'a'), ('trouble', 'n'), ('started', 'v'), ('bar', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('generous', 'a'), ('drinks', 'n'), ('came', 'v'), ('meal', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('IFE', 'n'), ('old', 'a'), ('clunky', 'a'), ('sufficient', 'a'), ('movies', 'n'), ('TV', 'n'), ('programmes', 'n'), ('75', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('legroom', 'n'), ('tight', 'v'), ('uneventful', 'a'), ('journey', 'n'), ('would', None), ('give', 'v'), ('thumbs', 'n'), ('ground', 'n'), ('services', 'n'), ('needs', 'v'), ('attention', 'n')]",evening flight LHR IAD a380 check T5 poor kiosk do not work well staff call Boarding poorly manage ground staff overwhelm full flight struggle manage passenger gate small insufficient seat big aircraft flight full leave 50 minute late pilot keep we informed issue airborne service start quite quickly cabin crew pleasant helpful job professionally efficiently answer call bell promptly nothing much trouble start bar service generous drink come meal service food good IFE old clunky sufficient movie tv programme 75 hour flight seat comfortable legroom tight uneventful journey would give thumb ground service need attention,0.9089,Positive
"  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain.",We boarded

And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen.

"  DFW-LHR. Had an easy transfer at DFW from American Airlines to British Airways heading to London. First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games. All in all it was an OK experience and did get me to London on time and our baggage arrived safely, but I'm not sold on the A380. T5 at LHR is another story that will be in a different review.

" The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.",The checkin process was smooth I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge On board was what all this flight was about This was my first time flying IntraEuropean Business Class and though I was well prepared I still found it underwhelming First the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off There is no personal IFE so basically no entertainment for a 3hour flight Meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the 2 choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago I could see that staff did their best but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do Also the 32 passengers shared one single WC meaning a long line for the bath room something I have rarely seen in business class Arrived at LHR we did not get a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come It finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5 such things will affect their reputation,,"[('checkin', 'n'), ('process', 'n'), ('smooth', 'a'), ('got', 'v'), ('access', 'n'), ('IGA', 'n'), ('Lounge', 'n'), ('nice', 'r'), ('nice', 'n'), ('Turkish', 'n'), ('Airlines', 'n'), ('Lounge', 'n'), ('board', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('IntraEuropean', 'n'), ('Business', 'n'), ('Class', 'n'), ('though', None), ('well', 'r'), ('prepared', 'a'), ('still', 'r'), ('found', 'v'), ('underwhelming', 'v'), ('First', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('normal', 'a'), ('economy', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('middle', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('blocked', 'v'), ('personal', 'a'), ('IFE', 'n'), ('basically', 'r'), ('entertainment', 'n'), ('3hour', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('Meal', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('slow', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('reached', 'v'), ('half', 'n'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('one', None), ('2', None), ('choices', 'n'), ('ran', 'v'), ('plus', None), ('meal', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('economy', 'n'), ('meal', 'n'), ('got', 'v'), ('Turkish', 'a'), ('Airlines', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('days', 'n'), ('ago', None), ('could', None), ('see', 'v'), ('staff', 'n'), ('best', 'a'), ('since', None), ('32', None), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('single', 'a'), ('aisle', 'n'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('small', 'a'), ('galley', 'n'), ('much', 'a'), ('could', None), ('Also', 'r'), ('32', None), ('passengers', 'n'), ('shared', 'v'), ('one', None), ('single', 'a'), ('WC', 'n'), ('meaning', 'v'), ('long', 'a'), ('line', 'n'), ('bath', 'n'), ('room', 'n'), ('something', 'n'), ('rarely', 'r'), ('seen', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('Arrived', 'n'), ('LHR', 'n'), ('get', 'v'), ('contact', 'n'), ('gate', 'n'), ('thing', 'n'), ('bus', 'n'), ('either', 'r'), ('crew', 'n'), ('announced', 'v'), ('idea', 'n'), ('bus', 'n'), ('would', None), ('come', 'v'), ('finally', 'r'), ('came', 'v'), ('course', 'n'), ('delay', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('airline', 'n'), ('since', None), ('BA', 'n'), ('main', 'a'), ('operator', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('T5', 'n'), ('things', 'n'), ('affect', 'v'), ('reputation', 'n')]",checkin process smooth get access IGA Lounge nice nice Turkish Airlines Lounge board flight first time fly IntraEuropean Business Class though well prepare still find underwhelme first seat normal economy seat middle seat block personal IFE basically entertainment 3hour flight Meal service slow time reach half business class cabin one 2 choice run plus meal good economy meal get Turkish Airlines flight day ago could see staff good since 32 business class passenger single aisle aircraft small galley much could also 32 passenger share one single wc mean long line bath room something rarely see business class arrive LHR get contact gate thing bus either crew announce idea bus would come finally come course delay airport airline since ba main operator Heathrow T5 thing affect reputation,0.9081,Positive

"  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself.

BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense.

"  British Airways personnel was just magnificent. My flight into London was delayed, security had long lines, I ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed). This while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line.

"  Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do.

"  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK.

"  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands. Seems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight.

"  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.",Three flights London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London Generally

"  Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise.

"  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim"").

"  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid.

"  Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. I am going to explore other options before using BA again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport.",Departure was about 40 minutes late The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back it is a real challenge to get out of the seat The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation I gave up trying to watch The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft felt unnatural The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wifes meal but no one responds better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours I am going to explore other options before using BA again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport,,"[('Departure', 'n'), ('40', None), ('minutes', 'n'), ('late', 'r'), ('A350', 'n'), ('flew', 'v'), ('eighteen', 'a'), ('months', 'n'), ('old', 'a'), ('seating', 'n'), ('spacing', 'v'), ('economy', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('seems', 'v'), ('tight', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('front', 'n'), ('fully', 'r'), ('tilted', 'v'), ('back', 'r'), ('real', 'a'), ('challenge', 'n'), ('get', 'v'), ('seat', 'n'), ('screen', 'n'), ('becomes', 'v'), ('close', 'a'), ('face', 'n'), ('becomes', 'v'), ('difficult', 'a'), ('focus', 'v'), ('screen', 'n'), ('Audio', 'n'), ('poor', 'a'), ('due', 'a'), ('music', 'n'), ('drowning', 'v'), ('conversation', 'n'), ('gave', 'v'), ('trying', 'v'), ('watch', 'v'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('seemed', 'v'), ('really', 'r'), ('struggle', 'v'), ('service', 'n'), ('felt', 'v'), ('disorganised', 'v'), ('Felt', 'n'), ('sorry', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('seemed', 'v'), ('working', 'v'), ('hard', 'a'), ('seems', 'v'), ('lot', 'n'), ('aisles', 'n'), ('type', 'n'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('felt', 'v'), ('unnatural', 'a'), ('overhead', 'a'), ('bins', 'n'), ('high', 'a'), ('many', 'a'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('difficulty', 'n'), ('accessing', 'v'), ('belongings', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('tried', 'v'), ('using', 'v'), ('overhead', 'a'), ('attendant', 'n'), ('light', 'n'), ('verify', 'v'), ('wifes', 'a'), ('meal', 'n'), ('one', None), ('responds', 'v'), ('better', 'r'), ('stop', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('attendant', 'n'), ('aisle', 'n'), ('Nice', 'n'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('two', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('fun', 'n'), ('close', 'r'), ('eleven', 'v'), ('hours', 'n'), ('going', 'v'), ('explore', 'v'), ('options', 'n'), ('using', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('hassle', 'n'), ('make', 'v'), ('contact', 'n'), ('anybody', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('puts', 'v'), ('even', 'r'), ('go', 'v'), ('airport', 'n')]",departure 40 minute late A350 fly eighteen month old seat space economy class seem tight seat front fully tilt back real challenge get seat screen become close face become difficult focus screen Audio poor due music drowning conversation give try watch cabin crew seem really struggle service feel disorganise Felt sorry cabin crew seem work hard seem lot aisle type aircraft feel unnatural overhead bin high many passenger difficulty access belonging flight try use overhead attendant light verify wife meal one respond well stop flight attendant aisle Nice aircraft two hour flight fun close eleven hour go explore option use BA hassle make contact anybody flight put even go airport,-0.6115,Negative

"  We left MIA late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane. We arrived late and so missed our connection at LHR to CDG.

They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Thus I had to book on another airline to return at the last moment.

"  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund.

"  Belfast to London on 20 Jun, 0650. I was informed at about 0200 flight BA1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025. I reached the airport at 0445, but BA counter was only open at 0510. At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales. For the next 2 hrs in the airport, I have been trying to contact BA, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, I have to called another number for “urgent cases”, which ever number I dial, I just couldn’t get to speak to any one till 0757. Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines.

"  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.",This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade Plus helpful and friendly FA Minuses The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space It was hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat even the FA found it difficult The inflight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films TV programmes and music The food choice and quality was poor one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible the cheese selection was also poor I dont know what the business class offerings from BAs rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia,,"[('new', 'a'), ('route', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('introduced', 'v'), ('beginning', 'n'), ('June', 'n'), ('several', 'a'), ('years', 'n'), ('Covid', 'n'), ('related', 'a'), ('delays', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('experience', 'n'), ('fear', 'v'), ('typical', 'a'), ('nickel', 'a'), ('dime', 'n'), ('policies', 'n'), ('introduced', 'v'), ('airline', 'n'), ('past', 'a'), ('decade', 'n'), ('Plus', None), ('helpful', 'a'), ('friendly', 'a'), ('FA', 'n'), ('Minuses', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('fairly', 'r'), ('cramped', 'v'), ('six', None), ('seats', 'n'), ('across', None), ('pod', 'n'), ('surprisingly', 'r'), ('little', 'a'), ('room', 'n'), ('limited', 'a'), ('storage', 'n'), ('space', 'n'), ('hard', 'a'), ('adjust', 'v'), ('seat', 'n'), ('particularly', 'r'), ('getting', 'v'), ('lie', 'v'), ('flat', 'a'), ('even', 'r'), ('FA', 'n'), ('found', 'v'), ('difficult', 'a'), ('inflight', 'a'), ('entertainment', 'n'), ('limited', 'a'), ('poor', 'a'), ('choice', 'n'), ('films', 'n'), ('TV', 'n'), ('programmes', 'n'), ('music', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('choice', 'n'), ('quality', 'n'), ('poor', 'a'), ('one', None), ('three', None), ('mains', 'n'), ('unavailable', 'a'), ('pea', 'n'), ('mushroom', 'n'), ('risotto', 'n'), ('almost', 'r'), ('inedible', 'a'), ('cheese', 'a'), ('selection', 'n'), ('also', 'r'), ('poor', 'a'), ('dont', 'v'), ('know', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('offerings', 'n'), ('BAs', 'n'), ('rivals', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('similar', 'a'), ('routes', 'n'), ('like', None), ('experience', 'n'), ('match', 'v'), ('provided', 'v'), ('Singapore', 'n'), ('Airlines', 'n'), ('flights', 'n'), ('Far', 'n'), ('East', 'n'), ('Australasia', 'n')]",new route BA introduce begin June several year Covid relate delay business class experience fear typical nickel dime policy introduce airline past decade plus helpful friendly FA Minuses cabin fairly cramp six seat across pod surprisingly little room limit storage space hard adjust seat particularly get lie flat even FA find difficult inflight entertainment limit poor choice film tv programme music food choice quality poor one three main unavailable pea mushroom risotto almost inedible cheese selection also poor do not know business class offering bas rival fly similar route like experience match provide Singapore Airlines flight Far East Australasia,-0.7184,Negative
"  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip. ",As a regular BA customer on European flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure 45 mins later 4 late customers were allowed to board and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew The benefit of low cost airlines is they they dont hang around for latecomers sadly BA is in a time warp over this BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last 23 years The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray only 2 choices by row 3 with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers It appears there is no supply control in place at BA Food quality was okay but while DoCo supply this the DoCo meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages I flew Turkish 10 days ago Staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin I end where I started BA standards continue to slip,,"[('regular', 'a'), ('BA', 'n'), ('customer', 'n'), ('European', 'a'), ('flights', 'n'), ('sad', 'a'), ('true', 'a'), ('note', 'v'), ('standards', 'n'), ('continue', 'v'), ('slip', 'v'), ('particularly', 'r'), ('ground', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('LHR', 'n'), ('atrocious', 'a'), ('handling', 'n'), ('delays', 'a'), ('Staff', 'n'), ('entrance', 'n'), ('First', 'n'), ('Wing', 'n'), ('brusque', 'v'), ('put', 'v'), ('mildly', 'r'), ('rude', 'v'), ('accurate', 'a'), ('Flight', 'n'), ('boarded', 'v'), ('1835', None), ('1900', None), ('departure', 'n'), ('45', None), ('mins', 'n'), ('later', 'r'), ('4', None), ('late', 'a'), ('customers', 'n'), ('allowed', 'v'), ('board', 'n'), ('single', 'a'), ('PA', 'n'), ('apology', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('deck', 'n'), ('crew', 'v'), ('benefit', 'n'), ('low', 'a'), ('cost', 'n'), ('airlines', 'n'), ('dont', 'v'), ('hang', 'v'), ('around', None), ('latecomers', 'n'), ('sadly', 'r'), ('BA', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('warp', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('pilots', 'n'), ('used', 'v'), ('best', 'a'), ('updating', 'v'), ('status', 'n'), ('dropped', 'v'), ('dramatically', 'r'), ('last', 'a'), ('23', None), ('years', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('standards', 'n'), ('choices', 'n'), ('T5', 'n'), ('First', 'n'), ('Lounge', 'n'), ('one', None), ('items', 'n'), ('improved', 'v'), ('post', 'n'), ('Covid', 'n'), ('Inflight', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('short', 'a'), ('2h', None), ('40m', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('light', 'a'), ('dinner', 'n'), ('tray', 'n'), ('2', None), ('choices', 'n'), ('row', 'n'), ('3', None), ('32', None), ('passengers', 'n'), ('Club', 'n'), ('Europe', 'n'), ('4', None), ('salad', 'n'), ('options', 'n'), ('available', 'a'), ('printed', 'v'), ('menu', 'r'), ('offered', 'v'), ('cabin', 'a'), ('staff', 'n'), ('explained', 'v'), ('given', 'v'), ('10', None), ('menus', 'n'), ('32', None), ('customers', 'n'), ('appears', 'v'), ('supply', 'n'), ('control', 'n'), ('place', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('Food', 'n'), ('quality', 'n'), ('okay', 'v'), ('DoCo', 'n'), ('supply', 'n'), ('DoCo', 'n'), ('meals', 'n'), ('Turkish', 'n'), ('Airlines', 'n'), ('remain', 'v'), ('superior', 'a'), ('BA', 'n'), ('manages', 'v'), ('flew', 'v'), ('Turkish', 'a'), ('10', None), ('days', 'n'), ('ago', 'r'), ('Staff', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('perfunctory', 'a'), ('attempt', 'n'), ('interact', 'v'), ('customers', 'n'), ('Club', 'n'), ('Europe', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('end', 'v'), ('started', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('standards', 'n'), ('continue', 'v'), ('slip', 'v')]",regular BA customer european flight sad true note standard continue slip particularly ground service LHR atrocious handling delay staff entrance First Wing brusque put mildly rude accurate Flight board 1835 1900 departure 45 min later 4 late customer allow board single PA apology flight deck crew benefit low cost airline do not hang around latecomer sadly BA time warp BA pilot use good update status drop dramatically last 23 year food standard choice T5 First Lounge one item improve post Covid Inflight service short 2h 40 m flight light dinner tray 2 choice row 3 32 passenger Club Europe 4 salad option available print menu offer cabin staff explain give 10 menu 32 customer appear supply control place BA Food quality okay DoCo supply DoCo meal Turkish Airlines remain superior BA manage fly turkish 10 day ago Staff service perfunctory attempt interact customer Club Europe cabin end start BA standard continue slip,0.5719,Positive

"  I could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing. This was a risk I was well aware about when travelling to Greece for my wedding. However, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset. The company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone).

"  The A80 is a wonderful aircraft - quieter than any other aircraft I've flown.

"  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?",Feels like

"  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again.",Recent trip to Boston departing LHR T5 Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the

"  As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge.

  We arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to BA was terrible. The airport security lines were not managed well.

"  BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me.

"  I have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response.

"  When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. When I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues.

"  I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor.""

"  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg.

" I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company.

However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling!

"  We booked a business class flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow via London. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed.

"  Total chaos for departures immigration at Malaga Airport. Boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.

At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.

"  Flew back on BA0254 Bridgetown to Heathrow in the old Club Class. A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful.

"  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive.

"  Flew to Barbados 16 March on BA 255 in the new Club Class suite. A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat.

"  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case.",Very poor flight from Cape Town to London After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly

"  Complete and utter chaos at Heathrow, yet again. Surely the CEO, Sean Doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous IT problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed.

"  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy.

"  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow.",British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite but BA59 had the 16yrsold packedlikesardines Club World product The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived On boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer We suspect this is another cynical timesaving initiative on the part of BA Frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy Its hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth Apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule Baggage handling was however atrociously slow,,"[('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('process', 'n'), ('upgrading', 'v'), ('777', None), ('fleet', 'n'), ('new', 'a'), ('Club', 'n'), ('Suite', 'n'), ('BA59', 'n'), ('16yrsold', None), ('packedlikesardines', 'n'), ('Club', 'n'), ('World', 'n'), ('product', 'n'), ('lounge', 'n'), ('CPT', 'n'), ('also', 'r'), ('bursting', 'v'), ('seams', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('orders', 'n'), ('behind', None), ('many', 'a'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('left', 'v'), ('time', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('arrived', 'v'), ('boarding', 'v'), ('surprised', 'v'), ('find', 'v'), ('menu', 'n'), ('amenity', 'n'), ('kit', 'n'), ('bottle', 'n'), ('water', 'n'), ('already', 'r'), ('placed', 'v'), ('storage', 'n'), ('drawer', 'n'), ('suspect', 'v'), ('another', None), ('cynical', 'a'), ('timesaving', 'n'), ('initiative', 'n'), ('part', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('Frustratingly', 'n'), ('menu', 'n'), ('turned', 'v'), ('incorrect', 'a'), ('replacement', 'n'), ('dishes', 'n'), ('probably', 'r'), ('worst', 'a'), ('ever', 'r'), ('encountered', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('airline', 'n'), ('drinks', 'n'), ('run', 'v'), ('cancelled', 'v'), ('without', None), ('warning', 'n'), ('spurious', 'a'), ('basis', 'n'), ('passenger', 'n'), ('nut', 'n'), ('allergy', 'v'), ('hard', 'a'), ('avoid', 'v'), ('suspicions', 'n'), ('cabin', 'v'), ('crew', 'n'), ('economical', 'a'), ('truth', 'n'), ('Apart', 'n'), ('rather', 'r'), ('turbulent', 'a'), ('ride', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('otherwise', 'r'), ('uneventful', 'a'), ('arrival', 'n'), ('slightly', 'r'), ('ahead', 'r'), ('schedule', 'n'), ('Baggage', 'n'), ('handling', 'n'), ('however', 'r'), ('atrociously', 'r'), ('slow', 'a')]",British Airways process upgrade 777 fleet new Club Suite BA59 16yrsold packedlikesardine Club World product lounge CPT also burst seam food order behind many passenger leave time food arrive boarding surprised find menu amenity kit bottle water already place storage drawer suspect another cynical timesave initiative part BA frustratingly menu turn incorrect replacement dish probably worst ever encounter business class airline drink run cancel without warn spurious basis passenger nut allergy hard avoid suspicion cabin crew economical truth apart rather turbulent ride flight otherwise uneventful arrival slightly ahead schedule baggage handling however atrociously slow,-0.9301,Negative
"  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy.",We flew to Funchal Madeira yesterday Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry yet BA asked us to upload our

"  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. Seats comfortable. Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready.

" I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again.",I really cant believe they have the audacity to call this First Class The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed so theyre using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in Suffice to say it was not pleasant Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training I had to ask for slippers The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim I mean its First Class not a student house party Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu Most of the food was awful My steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canap of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately I will say the cheese and port were nice However the worst thing was the constant galley noise There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat 1K which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so were in and out of that as well I will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally Im happy in Club and would never do First again,,"[('really', 'r'), ('cant', 'a'), ('believe', 'v'), ('audacity', 'n'), ('call', 'v'), ('First', 'a'), ('Class', 'n'), ('check', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('Singapore', 'n'), ('abrupt', 'a'), ('unhelpful', 'a'), ('official', 'a'), ('BA', 'n'), ('lounge', 'n'), ('Singapore', 'n'), ('closed', 'v'), ('theyre', 'a'), ('using', 'v'), ('cheap', 'a'), ('generic', 'n'), ('alternative', 'n'), ('anyone', 'n'), ('pay', 'v'), ('twenty', 'v'), ('pounds', 'n'), ('go', 'v'), ('Suffice', 'n'), ('say', 'v'), ('pleasant', 'a'), ('Onboard', 'n'), ('like', None), ('middle', 'n'), ('bad', 'a'), ('comedy', 'n'), ('sketch', 'n'), ('believe', 'v'), ('two', None), ('stewardess', 'n'), ('ever', 'r'), ('first', 'a'), ('class', 'n'), ('training', 'n'), ('ask', 'v'), ('slippers', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('drink', 'n'), ('took', 'v'), ('nearly', 'r'), ('hour', 'n'), ('arrive', 'v'), ('despite', None), ('8', None), ('passengers', 'n'), ('serve', 'v'), ('two', None), ('poor', 'a'), ('woman', 'n'), ('sat', 'v'), ('next', 'a'), ('ordered', 'v'), ('wine', 'n'), ('came', 'v'), ('filled', 'v'), ('brim', 'n'), ('mean', 'v'), ('First', 'n'), ('Class', 'n'), ('student', 'n'), ('house', 'n'), ('party', 'n'), ('Neither', 'n'), ('knowledge', 'n'), ('wines', 'n'), ('menu', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('awful', 'a'), ('steak', 'n'), ('dry', 'a'), ('cooked', 'a'), ('tough', 'a'), ('whichever', 'a'), ('catering', 'n'), ('manger', 'n'), ('signed', 'v'), ('canap', 'n'), ('soggy', 'a'), ('mushroom', 'n'), ('top', 'n'), ('chunk', 'n'), ('polenta', 'n'), ('sacked', 'v'), ('immediately', 'r'), ('say', 'v'), ('cheese', 'n'), ('port', 'n'), ('nice', 'a'), ('However', 'r'), ('worst', 'a'), ('thing', 'n'), ('constant', 'a'), ('galley', 'n'), ('noise', 'n'), ('cart', 'a'), ('stowage', 'n'), ('immediately', 'r'), ('front', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('1K', None), ('night', 'n'), ('appeared', 'v'), ('incapable', 'a'), ('shutting', 'v'), ('without', None), ('slamming', 'v'), ('also', 'r'), ('seemed', 'v'), ('stored', 'v'), ('personal', 'a'), ('belongings', 'n'), ('bin', 'n'), ('immediately', 'r'), ('seat', 'n'), ('well', 'r'), ('say', 'v'), ('seat', 'n'), ('well', 'r'), ('designed', 'v'), ('personally', 'r'), ('Im', 'n'), ('happy', 'a'), ('Club', 'n'), ('would', None), ('never', 'r'), ('First', 'r')]",really can not believe audacity call First Class check staff Singapore abrupt unhelpful official BA lounge Singapore close they re use cheap generic alternative anyone pay twenty pound go Suffice say pleasant Onboard like middle bad comedy sketch believe two stewardess ever first class training ask slipper first drink take nearly hour arrive despite 8 passenger serve two poor woman sit next order wine came fill brim mean First Class student house party neither knowledge wine menu food awful steak dry cook tough whichever cater manger sign canap soggy mushroom top chunk polenta sack immediately say cheese port nice however bad thing constant galley noise cart stowage immediately front seat 1 K night appear incapable shutting without slamming also seem store personal belonging bin immediately seat well say seat well design personally I m happy Club would never first,0.5994,Positive

" One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket.

" The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean.

" Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets.

"  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible. 
",Utterly appalling company Weve flown with them two times now and both times its been a disaster The first time Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours There was nobody at the gate to tell us this so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff There were none Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs where a very angry person told us it was our fault and we should have been given a letter We had no letter They then put us on a bus to the other terminal When we arrived there was nobody to greet us We were literally just left there We had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find us transport to the hotel When we got there we were told it was full and we couldnt choose our rooms We were given a terrible dirty cramped room Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved Eventually we got to board the next day My tray table was broken as was the window blind and I didnt get a meal No compensation was offered The second time I need to reschedule my flight The website assured me this was fine but provided no link I needed to phone up If you need to phone BA dont even bother trying I never got to speak to anyone and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling The food has been terrible meagre portions given infrequently My sandwich was inedible,,"[('Utterly', 'r'), ('appalling', 'v'), ('company', 'n'), ('Weve', 'n'), ('flown', 'n'), ('two', None), ('times', 'n'), ('times', 'n'), ('disaster', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('Return', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('24', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('nobody', 'n'), ('gate', 'n'), ('tell', 'v'), ('us', None), ('large', 'a'), ('group', 'n'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('roam', 'v'), ('round', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('looking', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('none', 'n'), ('Eventually', 'r'), ('another', None), ('airline', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('us', None), ('go', 'v'), ('unmarked', 'a'), ('stairs', 'n'), ('angry', 'a'), ('person', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('us', None), ('fault', 'n'), ('given', 'v'), ('letter', 'n'), ('letter', 'n'), ('put', 'v'), ('us', None), ('bus', 'n'), ('terminal', 'a'), ('arrived', 'v'), ('nobody', 'n'), ('greet', 'v'), ('us', None), ('literally', 'r'), ('left', 'v'), ('yet', 'r'), ('contact', 'a'), ('another', None), ('airline', 'n'), ('managed', 'v'), ('find', 'v'), ('us', None), ('transport', 'v'), ('hotel', 'n'), ('got', 'v'), ('told', 'v'), ('full', 'a'), ('couldnt', 'v'), ('choose', 'v'), ('rooms', 'n'), ('given', 'v'), ('terrible', 'a'), ('dirty', 'n'), ('cramped', 'v'), ('room', 'n'), ('Several', 'n'), ('times', 'n'), ('throughout', None), ('night', 'n'), ('called', 'v'), ('tell', 'v'), ('us', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('moved', 'v'), ('Eventually', 'r'), ('got', 'v'), ('board', 'n'), ('next', 'a'), ('day', 'n'), ('tray', 'n'), ('table', 'n'), ('broken', 'v'), ('window', 'n'), ('blind', 'n'), ('didnt', 'v'), ('get', 'v'), ('meal', 'n'), ('compensation', 'n'), ('offered', 'v'), ('second', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('need', 'v'), ('reschedule', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('website', 'n'), ('assured', 'v'), ('fine', 'a'), ('provided', 'v'), ('link', 'n'), ('needed', 'v'), ('phone', 'n'), ('need', 'v'), ('phone', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('dont', 'v'), ('even', 'r'), ('bother', 'r'), ('trying', 'v'), ('never', 'r'), ('got', 'v'), ('speak', 'v'), ('anyone', 'n'), ('ended', 'v'), ('booking', 'v'), ('hotel', 'n'), ('wait', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('rather', 'r'), ('rescheduling', 'v'), ('food', 'n'), ('terrible', 'a'), ('meagre', 'a'), ('portions', 'n'), ('given', 'v'), ('infrequently', 'r'), ('sandwich', 'n'), ('inedible', 'a')]",utterly appalling company we ve fly two time times disaster first time Return flight delay 24 hour nobody gate tell we large group passenger roam round Dubai airport look BA staff none eventually another airline tell we go unmarked stairs angry person tell we fault give letter letter put we bus terminal arrive nobody greet we literally leave yet contact another airline manage find we transport hotel got tell full could not choose room give terrible dirty cramp room several time throughout night call tell we flight move eventually get board next day tray table break window blind do not get meal compensation offer second time need reschedule flight website assure fine provide link need phone need phone BA do not even bother try never get speak anyone end book hotel wait flight rather reschedule food terrible meagre portion give infrequently sandwich inedible,-0.9659,Negative
 Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing! ,Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and

"  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested.

"  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.

"  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!",I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in When we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up Needless to say it never did Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked So I come back to the question Can big corporations lie with no accountability Why would I spend my hardearned money on something that gave me nothing extra Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers Stop your lying or update your promises,,"[('recently', 'r'), ('unfortunate', 'a'), ('privilege', 'n'), ('travelling', 'v'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('Detroit', 'n'), ('Bangalore', 'n'), ('back', 'r'), ('Given', 'n'), ('long', 'a'), ('arduous', 'a'), ('journey', 'n'), ('multiple', 'a'), ('layovers', 'n'), ('decided', 'v'), ('spend', 'v'), ('extra', 'a'), ('get', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('ticket', 'n'), ('quickly', 'r'), ('dissuaded', 'v'), ('misconception', 'n'), ('special', 'a'), ('spent', 'v'), ('extra', 'a'), ('money', 'n'), ('Business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('shoddy', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('rudeness', 'v'), ('insolence', 'v'), ('ground', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('experienced', 'v'), ('nothing', 'n'), ('frustration', 'n'), ('insecurity', 'n'), ('throughout', None), ('journeys', 'n'), ('trump', 'n'), ('stranded', 'v'), ('London', 'n'), ('missed', 'v'), ('connection', 'n'), ('spending', 'n'), ('close', 'r'), ('3', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('get', 'v'), ('front', 'n'), ('counter', 'n'), ('rebook', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('traveller', 'n'), ('bearing', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('stand', 'v'), ('one', None), ('gigantic', 'a'), ('line', 'n'), ('wait', 'v'), ('turn', 'n'), ('special', 'a'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('escorted', 'v'), ('Club', 'n'), ('World', 'n'), ('check', 'n'), ('asked', 'v'), ('lady', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('us', None), ('continue', 'v'), ('standing', 'v'), ('would', None), ('come', 'v'), ('back', 'r'), ('get', 'v'), ('us', None), ('counter', 'n'), ('freed', 'v'), ('Needless', 'a'), ('say', 'v'), ('never', 'r'), ('Finally', 'n'), ('got', 'v'), ('turn', 'n'), ('extra', 'a'), ('help', 'n'), ('ground', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('running', 'v'), ('around', 'r'), ('frenzy', 'n'), ('rebooked', 'v'), ('come', 'v'), ('back', 'r'), ('question', 'n'), ('big', 'a'), ('corporations', 'n'), ('lie', 'v'), ('accountability', 'n'), ('would', None), ('spend', 'v'), ('hardearned', 'a'), ('money', 'n'), ('something', 'n'), ('gave', 'v'), ('nothing', 'n'), ('extra', 'a'), ('Shame', 'n'), ('British', 'v'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('complete', 'a'), ('disregard', 'n'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('Stop', 'v'), ('lying', 'v'), ('update', 'v'), ('promises', 'n')]",recently unfortunate privilege travel British Airways Detroit Bangalore back give long arduous journey multiple layover decide spend extra get business class ticket quickly dissuade misconception special spend extra money business class shoddy service rudeness insolence ground staff experience nothing frustration insecurity throughout journey trump strand London miss connection spend close 3 hour get front counter rebook flight business class traveller bearing tell stand one gigantic line wait turn special passenger escort Club World check ask lady tell we continue stand would come back get we counter free Needless say never finally get turn extra help ground staff run around frenzy rebooke come back question big corporation lie accountability would spend hardearne money something give nothing extra Shame British Airways complete disregard passenger stop lie update promise,0.8732,Positive
"  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days.",I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as Ive witnessed the airline decline into a subpar service I understand that its been a tough two years for airlines but BAs decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted Enormous queues at JFK BA checkin terminal 7 Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining theyd miss their flights Terrible efficiency at the checkin counters At times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in The interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasnt pulling his weight Very poor I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like Im clinging on to my airline status which doesnt actually provide you a better service these days,,"[('flown', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('many', 'a'), ('years', 'n'), ('today', 'n'), ('another', None), ('poor', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('Ive', 'n'), ('witnessed', 'v'), ('airline', 'n'), ('decline', 'n'), ('subpar', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('understand', 'v'), ('tough', 'a'), ('two', None), ('years', 'n'), ('airlines', 'n'), ('BAs', 'n'), ('decline', 'n'), ('started', 'v'), ('pandemic', 'n'), ('truly', 'r'), ('plummeted', 'a'), ('Enormous', 'a'), ('queues', 'n'), ('JFK', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('checkin', 'v'), ('terminal', 'a'), ('7', None), ('Even', 'r'), ('priority', 'n'), ('lane', 'n'), ('standstill', 'n'), ('least', 'a'), ('half', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('people', 'n'), ('started', 'v'), ('complaining', 'v'), ('theyd', 'n'), ('miss', 'v'), ('flights', 'n'), ('Terrible', 'a'), ('efficiency', 'n'), ('checkin', 'n'), ('counters', 'n'), ('times', 'n'), ('one', None), ('member', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('processing', 'v'), ('people', 'n'), ('whilst', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('stood', 'v'), ('around', 'r'), ('phones', 'n'), ('chat', 'a'), ('One', None), ('member', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('stopped', 'v'), ('processing', 'v'), ('man', 'n'), ('desperately', 'r'), ('trying', 'v'), ('catch', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('order', 'n'), ('start', 'v'), ('processing', 'v'), ('someone', 'n'), ('else', 'r'), ('jumped', 'v'), ('interior', 'n'), ('plane', 'n'), ('generally', 'r'), ('filthy', 'a'), ('crumbs', 'n'), ('bits', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('stains', 'n'), ('marks', 'v'), ('around', None), ('seating', 'v'), ('area', 'n'), ('give', 'v'), ('single', 'a'), ('wet', 'n'), ('wipe', 'n'), ('used', 'v'), ('think', 'v'), ('hands', 'n'), ('see', 'v'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('wiping', 'v'), ('surrounding', 'a'), ('area', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('courteous', 'a'), ('members', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('also', 'r'), ('awful', 'a'), ('members', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('behave', 'v'), ('unprofessionally', 'r'), ('particular', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('one', None), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('swearing', 'v'), ('colleague', 'n'), ('back', 'n'), ('plane', 'n'), ('apparently', 'r'), ('wasnt', 'v'), ('pulling', 'v'), ('weight', 'n'), ('poor', 'a'), ('used', 'v'), ('proud', 'a'), ('BA', 'n'), ('flyer', 'n'), ('feel', 'v'), ('like', None), ('Im', 'n'), ('clinging', 'v'), ('airline', 'n'), ('status', 'n'), ('doesnt', 'v'), ('actually', 'r'), ('provide', 'v'), ('better', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('days', 'n')]",fly BA many year today another poor experience I ve witness airline decline subpar service understand tough two year airline BAs decline start pandemic truly plummet enormous queue JFK BA checkin terminal 7 even priority lane standstill least half hour people start complain they d miss flight terrible efficiency checkin counter time one member staff process people whilst BA staff stand around phone chat one member staff stop process man desperately try catch flight order start process someone else jump interior plane generally filthy crumb bit food stain mark around seat area give single wet wipe use think hand see passenger wipe surround area good courteous member staff also awful member staff behave unprofessionally particular flight one cabin crew swear colleague back plane apparently be not pull weight poor use proud BA flyer feel like I m cling airline status do not actually provide well service day,0.5171,Positive

"  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket.

"  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin.

" After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration.

"  I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I'd be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount.""

" Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze.",Very nice return flight with BA To add to my previous review I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as 100 passengers dont jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the 1hour hop very comfortable Once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers always coming and asking if any help is needed Lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food Great WiFi at really competitive pricing I think it is great that they also have food alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze,,"[('nice', 'a'), ('return', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('add', 'v'), ('previous', 'a'), ('review', 'n'), ('really', 'r'), ('like', None), ('BA', 'n'), ('organises', 'v'), ('boarding', 'n'), ('disembarking', 'v'), ('processes', 'n'), ('groups', 'n'), ('super', 'a'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('100', None), ('passengers', 'n'), ('dont', 'a'), ('jump', 'n'), ('sweat', 'n'), ('queue', 'n'), ('gate', 'n'), ('even', 'r'), ('A320', 'n'), ('new', 'a'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('fresh', 'a'), ('feeling', 'n'), ('nice', 'a'), ('mood', 'n'), ('lighting', 'v'), ('Row', 'n'), ('1', None), ('enhanced', 'v'), ('legroom', 'n'), ('thus', 'r'), ('makes', 'v'), ('1hour', None), ('hop', 'n'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('amazing', 'a'), ('staff', 'n'), ('even', 'r'), ('attentive', 'a'), ('accommodating', 'v'), ('Gold', 'n'), ('level', 'n'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('always', 'r'), ('coming', 'v'), ('asking', 'v'), ('help', 'n'), ('needed', 'v'), ('Lovely', 'r'), ('humus', 'a'), ('beetroot', 'n'), ('quinoa', 'n'), ('salad', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('Great', 'n'), ('WiFi', 'n'), ('really', 'r'), ('competitive', 'a'), ('pricing', 'n'), ('think', 'v'), ('great', 'a'), ('also', 'r'), ('food', 'n'), ('alcohol', 'n'), ('offered', 'v'), ('buy', 'v'), ('online', 'n'), ('travel', 'n'), ('classes', 'n'), ('Domestic', 'n'), ('T5', 'n'), ('arrivals', 'n'), ('breeze', 'n')]",nice return flight BA add previous review really like BA organise boarding disembarking process group super comfortable 100 passenger do not jump sweat queue gate even A320 new cabin fresh feel nice mood light Row 1 enhance legroom thus make 1hour hop comfortable amazing staff even attentive accommodate gold level passenger always come ask help need lovely humus beetroot quinoa salad food great WiFi really competitive pricing think great also food alcohol offered buy online travel class Domestic T5 arrival breeze,0.991,Positive
"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",Overall a very lovely flight with BA to

"  I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back.

That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk.

"  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all.

"  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight.

"  Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was.

"  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK.

" Arrived at the South airport in Tenerife 2 hours before departure, Iberia had not opened the check in. Even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post COVID took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front.

"  Outbound, seated in row 10, I was told they had run out of my chosen food option (shepherd's pie), so I had to settle for gnocchi. The steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier - as if BA could not get a better one!

"  Flew Club Europe London - Tenerife South 5 November and returned 12 November. Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue. Also not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two.

"  Upon checking in at the Club desk in Lisbon airport our Passenger Locator Forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our Day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding, causing my wife, who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the U.K., much distress. He was only doing his job of course, but we requested him to call a Supervisor. The Check in Manager, Goncalo Ribeiro, came to our rescue.

"  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed.

"  I booked and paid for what I thought was a business class seat on a flight to Athens. What I got was a premium economy seat.

" This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate.

"  I had booked a flight from Heathrow on Friday 27th August 2021 to fly to Manchester Airport. On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake.

However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages.

  I’ve had to book six flights with BA recently. All have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. The latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights.

We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far.

  The service is got super inconsistent on BA and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy. The flight down from London I was in business class I asked for the mini bottle of champagne that I always treat myself to the cabin crew member said I can’t give you the bottle only a glass. However the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga.

"  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York.

" Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worse. We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies).

  I flew on British Airways Cheapest Fare which was a Hand Baggage Only fare in Economy Class. Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each. The value for money here is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.,I flew on British Airways Cheapest Fare which was a Hand Baggage Only fare in Economy Class Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each The value for money here is incredible The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water There was Wifi onboard which we paid 1199 for the full flight access package and it was great It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands,,"[('flew', 'v'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('Cheapest', 'n'), ('Fare', 'n'), ('Hand', 'n'), ('Baggage', 'n'), ('fare', 'v'), ('Economy', 'n'), ('Class', 'n'), ('Despite', None), ('cheapest', 'a'), ('fare', 'n'), ('actually', 'r'), ('carry', 'v'), ('two', None), ('pieces', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('luggage', 'n'), ('weighing', 'v'), ('23KG', None), ('value', 'n'), ('money', 'n'), ('incredible', 'a'), ('ground', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('Heathrow', 'n'), ('polite', 'a'), ('helpful', 'a'), ('plane', 'n'), ('clean', 'a'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('smiley', 'a'), ('polite', 'v'), ('short', 'a'), ('haul', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('given', 'v'), ('free', 'a'), ('packet', 'n'), ('crisps', 'n'), ('bottle', 'n'), ('water', 'n'), ('Wifi', 'n'), ('onboard', 'r'), ('paid', 'v'), ('1199', None), ('full', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('access', 'n'), ('package', 'n'), ('great', 'a'), ('fast', 'r'), ('enough', 'a'), ('stream', 'v'), ('movie', 'n'), ('Netflix', 'n'), ('considering', 'v'), ('low', 'a'), ('cost', 'n'), ('carrier', 'n'), ('premium', 'a'), ('carrier', 'n'), ('like', None), ('BA', 'n'), ('pay', 'v'), ('extra', 'a'), ('fly', 'n'), ('premium', 'n'), ('carrier', 'n'), ('generous', 'a'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('luggage', 'n'), ('allowance', 'n'), ('free', 'a'), ('snacks', 'n'), ('board', 'n'), ('may', None), ('end', 'v'), ('cheaper', 'a'), ('nobody', 'n'), ('claps', 'n'), ('plane', 'n'), ('lands', 'n')]",fly British Airways Cheapest Fare Hand Baggage fare economy Class despite cheap fare actually carry two piece cabin luggage weigh 23kg value money incredible ground staff London Heathrow polite helpful plane clean cabin crew smiley polite short haul flight give free packet crisp bottle water Wifi onboard pay 1199 full flight access package great fast enough stream movie Netflix consider low cost carrier premium carrier like BA pay extra fly premium carrier generous cabin luggage allowance free snacks board may end cheap nobody clap plane land,0.9786,Positive

"  I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route.

" After sixteen months of being grounded by COVID, it felt almost surreal to be back in T5, heading for what to us was essential summer sun in Greece. T5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security, and even the Galleries South lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape Boris Johnson’s bully boy attitude. Ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets. The flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’.

Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers.

"  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise.

Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight.

"  Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.",Overall I

"  I have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in Club Europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. The stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways. Everything I expected from this flight was fulfilled. The one thing I can complain about is baggage handling at Heathrow.

After I pointed out the error she ignored me so I filed a claim with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution and BA sent them a defences. They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there.

"  I was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. The plane to London was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense.

"  I booked flights to Rome from the US and then home through London to LAX in February of this year for the 1st of August. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February.

I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways.

"  I booked a trip to Spain for mid-March 2020 with American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia. I needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to Europe that began in March. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets should have been refunded.

"  I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. When I said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.

"  London-Heathrow to Warsaw on 14th March. British Airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience, starting from check in and ending on the deplaning. Very friendly, smiling, chatty people throughout my journey, including the lovely captain, who gave all the information about delay, missed slot and new departure time. What is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here. The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially. I didn't try the paid Marks&Spencer on board service but I think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free. The one thing I can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet. Whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean, the toilet was filthy.

" Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. Basically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane. Lessons learned, avoid if you can.

"  I flew to Vancouver mid March to see my mother, then in hospital. Three days after arrival my mother passed away and I subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral. I tried to manage my booking online, as BA suggest. But, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer services.

"  I booked my flights to the UK in May 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the UK on March 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on March 16, 2020 and because I am older and have pre-existing health conditions, my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy.

"  I am flying London to Seattle in Business Class in May 2020, and British Airways wants around £100 each way for me to choose seats. All other airlines I have encountered allow Business Class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost. They decided to change my seat ""for operational reasons""s. What could that reason be?

"  Johannesburg to London. Whoever designed the refurbished Galleries Lounge at JNB has no understanding of acoustics, as every syllable of a Facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away. Add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience.

Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product.

"  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.",Las Vegas to Gatwick A very disappointing service for Club World it felt like I was travelling in economy with attitude

"  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.",San Diego to Stockholm via London Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been

" On 4th of December before my flight's departure I got my purse stolen in NYC with all my money and my passport in it. Thanks to the kind strangers I managed to get to the Danish embassy and get a temporary passport. When I arrived at the JFK Airport it was too late and I wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage. With tears in my eyes I went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free, got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened.

"  Mumbai to Boston via London. My flight with British airways was really good. The catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good. However, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the IFE box blocking space in front of you. Also, BA had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in. They have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston.

"  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.",Toronto to Geneva via London I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service Apparently things have

"  London to Los Angeles. Take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control. I was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around.

"  Overall a very comfortable flight with British Airways. Both of my flights took off on time and reached on time. I was really excited to fly BA since they changed the aircraft from Boeing 777-200 to a Boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. Everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. However, during the lunch service, they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian. Overall, my both flights with BA were good. There are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of USB ports, Power Outlet, Old IFE, the IFE box in front of you that blocks your legroom.

"  Rio De Janeiro to London Heathrow. Love this aircraft, only a 3 Class, Business, World Traveller Plus and Economy Class. 2 Cabins in Business class Front 3 rows and Rear 2 Rows. I had seat 3A, In my opinion the seat, Window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat (at 6'4'' a little extra helps) very private tucked behind second galley area, toilet is over the other side J/K.

"  Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos.

" Keflavik to London Heathrow. Cabin crew were amazing. Weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough. Expecting a delay and seeing other European flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding. Snow in blizzard conditions, we were surprised but got settled in our seats. Crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di-icing machine we finally made our way to take off. All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time. The first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not BA fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off. How the pilot and team managed this in these conditions I will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to Heathrow. Cabin crew provided excellent service. Being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent. Veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely. So just want to thank you BA. We know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we can't fault you. Particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us.

The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself.

"  London Heathrow to Rio De Janeiro. Not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites, this aircraft today has a First Class but was flown empty as it usually only offers Club World. Flight not full, Seated in 7F aisle seat, no one in the middle seat so very pleasant. It is away from the Toilet over at 7A/B but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight. Food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual, plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist, again nothing any trouble at all.

"  Budapest to Billund return via London on 18 and 28 Dec. 2019. A320 aircrafts. Check-In in Budapest had a narrow timeslot of 2 hours before departure with long queues. I was not recognised as Oneworld elite flyer (hold a Gold Card with Qatar Airways) at check-in and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggage. I was denied lounge access as QR does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on QR. There is no Oneworld  lounge in Budapest, so BA uses Menzies Lounge who would not accept me unless I was with an entitled Oneworld card different from Qatar Airways. For BA I do not have status. In London granted access to any Oneworld lounge. Onboard, food and drinks with hefty price tags,  water is not free. Flights were full, but on time. I found that the onboard charity collection by FAs is inappropriate and intrusive. Luggage delivered perfectly. Return trips (2 legs) were both full flights but departed slightly early. Granted lounge access in Billund in the decent King Amlet and BA Galleries First in T3 in London. Loads of good, hot foods and good beers and wines. Onboard there is no IFE, no seat recline.

"  New York to London. I was on the last flight out at 11.35 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects.  The Boeing 777 certainly showed its age. IFE screen was tiny, seat was well used. The flight time was quick (5.50 hours) and thats about it. FA is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me.

Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 18:00 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd.

" London to New York JFK. We were booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service ""business class""? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation.

"  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.

"  Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go.

"  London to Johannesburg with British Airways. BA’s B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. It’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films.

" The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a ""mix up"" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a ""mix up"" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do.

" Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well. The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. I always recommend BA - and will continue to do so.",Tirana to London Gatwick I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while I almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others We boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew While the flight was fully booked my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of WiFi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe In fact the WiFi package I got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast as good as my home connection This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as I am 188 cm tall Also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight only drinks This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast but I managed well The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we deboarded quickly I always recommend BA and will continue to do so,,"[('Tirana', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('Gatwick', 'n'), ('fly', 'v'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('around', None), ('six', None), ('times', 'n'), ('month', 'n'), ('thanks', 'n'), ('work', 'n'), ('almost', 'r'), ('always', 'r'), ('pleasant', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('past', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('definitely', 'r'), ('outdid', None), ('others', 'n'), ('boarded', 'v'), ('departed', 'v'), ('exactly', 'r'), ('time', 'n'), ('friendly', 'a'), ('welcoming', 'v'), ('crew', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('fully', 'r'), ('booked', 'v'), ('travel', 'n'), ('companion', 'n'), ('lucky', 'a'), ('one', 'n'), ('sitting', 'v'), ('row', 'n'), ('could', None), ('empty', 'a'), ('middle', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('therefore', 'r'), ('space', 'n'), ('best', 'a'), ('surprise', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('far', 'r'), ('availability', 'n'), ('WiFi', 'n'), ('never', 'r'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('within', None), ('Europe', 'n'), ('fact', 'n'), ('WiFi', 'n'), ('package', 'n'), ('got', 'v'), ('included', 'v'), ('texting', 'v'), ('unlimited', 'a'), ('incredibly', 'r'), ('fast', 'r'), ('good', 'a'), ('home', 'n'), ('connection', 'n'), ('truly', 'r'), ('made', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('enjoyable', 'a'), ('allowed', 'v'), ('continue', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('even', 'r'), ('flight', 'n'), ('extremely', 'r'), ('valuable', 'a'), ('Something', 'v'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('improve', 'v'), ('would', None), ('leg', 'a'), ('space', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('noticed', 'v'), ('particularly', 'r'), ('tight', 'a'), ('although', None), ('common', 'a'), ('problem', 'n'), ('188', None), ('cm', 'n'), ('tall', 'n'), ('Also', 'r'), ('unknown', 'a'), ('reasons', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('snacks', 'n'), ('served', 'v'), ('2', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('45', None), ('minute', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('drinks', 'v'), ('slight', 'a'), ('struggle', 'n'), ('skipped', 'v'), ('breakfast', 'n'), ('managed', 'v'), ('well', 'r'), ('flight', 'n'), ('however', 'r'), ('arrived', 'v'), ('ahead', 'r'), ('schedule', 'n'), ('deboarded', 'v'), ('quickly', 'r'), ('always', 'r'), ('recommend', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('continue', 'v')]",Tirana London Gatwick fly British Airways around six time month thank work almost always pleasant experience past flight definitely outdid other board depart exactly time friendly welcoming crew flight fully book travel companion lucky one sit row could empty middle seat therefore space good surprise flight far availability WiFi never British Airways flight within Europe fact WiFi package got include texting unlimited incredibly fast good home connection truly make flight enjoyable allow continue business even flight extremely valuable something British Airways improve would leg space flight notice particularly tight although common problem 188 cm tall also unknown reason food snack serve 2 hour 45 minute flight drink slight struggle skip breakfast manage well flight however arrive ahead schedule deboarde quickly always recommend BA continue,0.9876,Positive

" London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

"  London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.",London to Cape Town We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa I usually fly Star Alliance

" London to Malaga. A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude. At the checking at Gatwick airport, I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from Malaga. SMS confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status. At Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. When asked the BA guy at the lounge kiosk, he said I could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. Surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. At the gate, we were told the aircraft was replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15. Stiff and no recliner seats. Cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is.

"  Kuala Lumpur to Glasgow via London. The service started, first some drinks. On my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant.  I asked for an ale, the attendant pretended not to understand what I was asking for. I repeated many times the word ale with my Spanish accent, but she still did not catch it. The male attendant said “like an IPA”, I answered “yes”.  I changed to a beer and she offered me Amstel or Heineken, I chose Amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. When the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. For the meal I chose the beef and asked for a beer. The male attendant realized that the empty can was still there, took it. With the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so I stopped another attendant going to Business class and he came back with an option of Tiger or Heineken lager.

"  Terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy. This was easily the most cramped space I have ever flown. And I travel a lot. The flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort. The little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting. If the seat in front of you reclines, as they invariably do, there is even less room. Shameful. The food was below average as well, even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food.

"  Buenos Aires to London Heathrow rwturn. The aircraft is very old, cabin configuration is very old and tired. IFE screens have not been changed since they were first installed. My Ipod has a larger and more responsive screen. Before taking off in Buenos Aires, some pax, but not all, were offered water or orange juice. I never got any. After take off, drinks were offered, followed by a hot meal. Food choices ran out in the first row. Seats were uncomfortable, footrests were jammed. On the return flight, sparkling wine and water were offered before take off, followed by drinks and the meal I had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes. Poor movie choices, miniature screen and uncomfortable seats. Crew OK. No indication as to which toilets to use, either forward in business class or rear economy.

On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight.

" I wish I could give a zero. I was booked on a flight from Newark to Madrid via London. I come to find that the minimum layover time in London is 1 hr. My flight layover in London was 1hr5min. British Airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in London were the same, but that was a total lie. My wife and I were sprinting across the airport, but between getting off the aeroplane, having to go through security again, and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection, we missed the layover flight. We had the same route in the reverse direction. I called BA hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation. They kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than London’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way. British Airways has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something. I will never be flying BA again and plan on converting my company away from BA flights as well. Be warned.

" We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars!

" London Heathrow to Austin with British Airways. It was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to Austin. But, it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time.

"  I did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. This review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28.

" The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later.

" Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was

"  Los Angeles to Istanbul via London. Flight between London and Istanbul is like coach, no TV and small leg room. Transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed.

"  London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way.

  London to Bangkok. What an awful plane. Seats are just about OK going. Coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat. Really uncomfortable.

"  Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights.

"  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight.

here So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways All of the other outstanding carriers dont charge nearly the high fees and most dont charge for reserving your seats in advance Instead of BA we changed our booking to 1030 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi Their customer service was outstanding The fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other I am entering travel in September 2019 because there was no other option for future travel This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware,,"[('London', 'n'), ('Johannesburg', 'n'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('one', None), ('commercial', 'a'),

"  I had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from Chennai to London by British airways. The Chennai Ground Service Manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley, screening the luggage, checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person. I am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. Thank you so much. Inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard.

"  I was supposed to fly from London City to Amsterdam on 24/7, Business Class. Once at LCY, my early pm flight appeared as cancelled. A state of confusion broke out at the airport, with people trying to find alternatives, however I managed to be rebooked on a later flight. On a busy day, I waited for hours at the airport. The new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. I kept on waiting. The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Result: half a day wasted at LCY. I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany.

"  Good morning. I would like to write a review for British Airways. It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get over what happened to me. But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing!

My other flights with BA this year has been delayed too. They have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$.

"  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it.

 London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. This was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. I am sure the plane was the same. I am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BA. I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS.

" From Toronto to Pisa British Airways used a wet leased Air Belgium plane. Crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily. Food was excellent. Business Class cabin comfortable. Weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at LHR.

Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day!

" A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business.",A

"  What happened to a great airline? Got to Heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared. 45 minutes later a BA guy asks for Vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through. There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us.

"  London Heathrow to Malaga in business class. Full and very large Club Europe cabin on this morning flight. Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting.

" Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route.

"  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.",Grenada to Gatwick Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin The cabin was much smarter previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant The entertainment system was hugely improved with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated But the family really found them entertaining For me the real issue was the tight leg room I am a slim 6ft 2 and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal It was for me very tight Previously the seat format was 333 It is now 343 We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 242 We sat in a 2 which was more bearable I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit Despite best efforts to sleep I failed I remember the old seats being more comfortable especially for long haul Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights edible In summary it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience but seat comfort has been sacrificed which is a great pity,,"[('Grenada', 'n'), ('Gatwick', 'n'), ('flown', 'v'), ('BA', 'n'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('type', 'n'), ('prior', 'r'), ('refurbishment', 'v'), ('intrigued', 'v'), ('experience', 'v'), ('changes', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('much', 'a'), ('smarter', 'r'), ('previous', 'a'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('looked', 'v'), ('tired', 'a'), ('lighting', 'n'), ('pleasant', 'a'), ('entertainment', 'n'), ('system', 'n'), ('hugely', 'r'), ('improved', 'v'), ('good', 'a'), ('selection', 'n'), ('media', 'n'), ('larger', 'a'), ('touch', 'n'), ('screen', 'n'), ('devices', 'n'), ('suppose', 'v'), ('reason', 'n'), ('appreciated', 'v'), ('old', 'a'), ('systems', 'n'), ('hopelessly', 'r'), ('outdated', 'v'), ('family', 'n'), ('really', 'r'), ('found', 'v'), ('entertaining', 'v'), ('real', 'a'), ('issue', 'n'), ('tight', 'a'), ('leg', 'n'), ('room', 'n'), ('slim', 'a'), ('6ft', None), ('2', None), ('lack', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('width', 'n'), ('made', 'v'), ('almost', 'r'), ('impossible', 'a'), ('eat', 'v'), ('meal', 'n'), ('tight', 'v'), ('Previously', 'r'), ('seat', 'n'), ('format', 'n'), ('333', None), ('343', None), ('sat', 'v'), ('4', None), ('outbound', 'n'), ('although', None), ('return', 'n'), ('sat', 'v'), ('near', None), ('back', 'n'), ('economy', 'n'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('narrows', 'n'), ('seats', 'n'), ('become', 'v'), ('242', None), ('sat', 'v'), ('2', None), ('bearable', 'a'), ('also', 'r'), ('found', 'v'), ('seat', 'n'), ('really', 'r'), ('hard', 'r'), ('couple', 'n'), ('hours', 'n'), ('although', None), ('sitting', 'v'), ('supplied', 'v'), ('back', 'r'), ('rest', 'a'), ('cushion', 'n'), ('helped', 'v'), ('bit', 'n'), ('Despite', None), ('best', 'a'), ('efforts', 'n'), ('sleep', 'v'), ('failed', 'v'), ('remember', 'v'), ('old', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('especially', 'r'), ('long', 'a'), ('haul', 'n'), ('Service', 'n'), ('professional', 'a'), ('timely', 'a'), ('food', 'n'), ('similar', 'a'), ('previous', 'a'), ('flights', 'n'), ('edible', 'a'), ('summary', 'a'), ('seems', 'v'), ('shame', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('improved', 'v'), ('aspects', 'n'), ('experience', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('comfort', 'n'), ('sacrificed', 'v'), ('great', 'a'), ('pity', 'n')]",Grenada Gatwick fly BA aircraft type prior refurbishment intrigue experience change cabin cabin much smart previous aircraft look tired lighting pleasant entertainment system hugely improve good selection medium large touch screen device suppose reason appreciate old system hopelessly outdate family really find entertain real issue tight leg room slim 6 ft 2 lack seat width make almost impossible eat meal tight previously seat format 333 343 sit 4 outbound although return sit near back economy aircraft narrow seat become 242 sit 2 bearable also find seat really hard couple hour although sit supply back rest cushion help bit despite good effort sleep fail remember old seat comfortable especially long haul Service professional timely food similar previous flight edible summary seem shame BA improve aspect experience seat comfort sacrifice great pity,0.9398,Positive

" Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother!

for dogs on our flight it was salmon we think as it didnt taste of anything a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it The veg tasted burnt bread roll was ok Not really a saving grace One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and dont bother asking what was in the box left on our table I didnt bother trying it The look on other peoples faces was good enough for me to know dont bother Which in comparison to the outbound flight London to Orlando was worlds apart greeted with a drink which was the first of many dinner was nice the steak edible veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldnt log on so saved some money there I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane But that really shouldnt happen What is not told when booking homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have TSA PRE you dont have to join the massive queue look for pre entered TSA line

We are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time, but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates. No water provided. I felt unwell but was told they had no glasses, so nothing to drink. Numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures.

" New York to Glasgow via London. A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York.

"  BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful.

Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water.

"  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",Belfast City

"  London to Nashville. The worst airline Trans-Atlantic. Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip.

"  Gatwick to Madrid. When I arrived I waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase. It didn’t arrive.  I was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which I did and given a number to call the next day. The representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by 5.00 p.m. I was out during the day. When I returned later that evening there was no suitcase. It hadn’t been delivered.

"  My boyfriend and I wanted to return from our trip to London a day early but the BA app and website continued to glitch so I called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier. I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. The flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work.

  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early.

"  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen.

" London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very nice experience. I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we had.

" CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule.

"  Sofia to Belfast via London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible. I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation.

" I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me.

"  
Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing.

"  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios.

"  Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher.

"  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home.

"  I paid an extra £500 for two Premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed. The seat felt small and was shabby, the tv screen was small and very dark. I tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable. The whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any way.

" Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist.

"  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight.

"  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.",Bucharest to London My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed from a European destination to London I applied for compensation for this delay Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances comparable with weather issues and that therefore they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight However there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy I believe that if not on legal basis British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay within Europe is significant Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong But this experience proved to me that its not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways,,"[('Bucharest', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('7', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('European', 'a'), ('destination', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('applied', 'v'), ('compensation', 'n'), ('delay', 'n'), ('Initially', 'r'), ('informed', 'v'), ('EU', 'n'), ('regulations', 'n'), ('would', None), ('receive', 'v'), ('400', None), ('Euros', 'n'), ('compensation', 'n'), ('informed', 'v'), ('4', None), ('days', 'n'), ('later', 'r'), ('error', 'n'), ('longer', 'a'), ('getting', 'v'), ('compensated', 'v'), ('British', 'a'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('argued', 'v'), ('sickness', 'n'), ('crew', 'a'), ('member', 'n'), ('considered', 'v'), ('extraordinary', 'a'), ('circumstances', 'n'), ('comparable', 'a'), ('weather', 'n'), ('issues', 'n'), ('therefore', 'n'), ('compensate', 'v'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('However', 'r'), ('court', 'n'), ('precedence', 'n'), ('cases', 'n'), ('clearly', 'r'), ('show', 'v'), ('crew', 'n'), ('sickness', 'n'), ('considered', 'v'), ('extraordinary', 'a'), ('circumstance', 'n'), ('airlines', 'n'), ('responsibility', 'n'), ('contingency', 'n'), ('strategy', 'n'), ('cases', 'n'), ('compensate', 'v'), ('talked', 'v'), ('manager', 'n'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('nothing', 'n'), ('policy', 'n'), ('believe', 'v'), ('legal', 'a'), ('basis', 'n'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('compensated', 'v'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('reasons', 'n'), ('7', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('delay', 'n'), ('within', None), ('Europe', 'n'), ('significant', 'a'), ('Many', 'a'), ('times', 'n'), ('picked', 'v'), ('fly', 'v'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n'), ('based', 'v'), ('expectations', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('case', 'n'), ('anything', 'n'), ('going', 'v'), ('wrong', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('proved', 'v'), ('worth', 'a'), ('investing', 'v'), ('extra', 'a'), ('money', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('British', 'n'), ('Airways', 'n')]",Bucharest London flight British Airways 7 hour delay european destination London apply compensation delay initially inform EU regulation would receive 400 Euros compensation inform 4 day later error long get compensate British Airways argue sickness crew member consider extraordinary circumstance comparable weather issue therefore compensate passenger flight However court precedence case clearly show crew sickness consider extraordinary circumstance airline responsibility contingency strategy case compensate talk manager customer service tell nothing policy believe legal basis British Airways compensated customer service reason 7 hour delay within Europe significant many time pick fly British Airways base expectation good customer service case anything go wrong experience prove worth invest extra money fly British Airways,-0.7327,Negative

"  Madrid to London. We paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again.

"  London Heathrow to Houston. Despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after. Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late.

"  I booked my BA flight from Zurich to London Heathrow using Avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German.

"  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it.

  Leeds Bradford to Las Vegas via Heathrow. Customer services handling of my question never answered it.

This was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short LBA LHR fare. I asked why the fare was so much when I could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one checked bag. I asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. Book LHR LAS at that time and one bag included.

"  Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers.

" Heathrow to Larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout.

"  Los Angeles to London. A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour.

"  London to Phoenix, BA289 yesterday. The plane was supposed to land at 1835. However, it landed at 1940. Because of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American Airlines. By the time I was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030.

They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning.

"  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years.

overbooking Apologetic ground staff defending the indefensible but no apology on the plane Fuming all the way back to London exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service tea when I asked for coffee and filthy food Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology

"  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA.

London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good.",London Heathrow Pisa return My wife and I fly this route 34 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price or

 Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board.

"  Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty.

"  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten.

"  Doha to London Heathrow. Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world.

"  London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were.

I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into.

" San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later.

However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes.

"  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.

"  London to Athens. Classic BA love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster. Problems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutes.

"  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London.",I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow In the beginning everything went

"  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.",Tokyo to London I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787 We had a good checkin experience breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded The food and wines were really good I had a beautifullypresented Japanese starter followed by a bentostyle lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen On the downside the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passengers footrest to access the aisle The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight,,"[('Tokyo', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('looking', 'v'), ('forward', 'r'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Club', 'n'), ('World', 'n'), ('ticket', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('Boeing', 'n'), ('787', None), ('good', 'a'), ('checkin', 'n'), ('experience', 'n'), ('breezed', 'v'), ('airport', 'n'), ('enjoyed', 'v'), ('JAL', 'n'), ('Lounge', 'n'), ('Narita', 'n'), ('boarded', 'v'), ('time', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('impressions', 'n'), ('Boeing', 'n'), ('787', None), ('good', 'a'), ('modern', 'a'), ('plane', 'n'), ('nice', 'a'), ('mood', 'n'), ('lighting', 'v'), ('boarded', 'v'), ('food', 'n'), ('wines', 'n'), ('really', 'r'), ('good', 'a'), ('beautifullypresented', 'v'), ('Japanese', 'a'), ('starter', 'n'), ('followed', 'v'), ('bentostyle', 'a'), ('lunch', 'n'), ('final', 'a'), ('reminder', 'n'), ('holiday', 'n'), ('wife', 'n'), ('chose', 'v'), ('western', 'a'), ('options', 'n'), ('plenty', 'n'), ('choice', 'n'), ('IFE', 'n'), ('big', 'a'), ('screen', 'n'), ('downside', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('hot', 'a'), ('made', 'v'), ('difficult', 'a'), ('sleep', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('problem', 'n'), ('encountered', 'v'), ('outbound', 'n'), ('journey', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('reclined', 'v'), ('fully', 'r'), ('find', 'v'), ('layout', 'n'), ('BA', 'n'), ('Club', 'n'), ('World', 'n'), ('little', 'a'), ('awkward', 'n'), ('step', 'v'), ('another', None), ('passengers', 'n'), ('footrest', 'v'), ('access', 'n'), ('aisle', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('efficient', 'a'), ('seemed', 'v'), ('bit', 'n'), ('exhausted', 'a'), ('could', None), ('friendly', 'a'), ('welcoming', 'v'), ('context', 'n'), ('review', 'n'), ('spoiled', 'v'), ('flew', 'v'), ('first', 'a'), ('class', 'n'), ('way', 'n'), ('Tokyo', 'n'), ('amazing', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), ('exemplary', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('felt', 'v'), ('bit', 'n'), ('disappointed', 'a'), ('return', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('comparison', 'n'), ('felt', 'v'), ('room', 'n'), ('improvement', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('expectations', 'n'), ('might', None), ('high', 'a'), ('previous', 'a'), ('flight', 'n')]",Tokyo London look forward flight Club World ticket first time fly Boeing 787 good checkin experience breeze airport enjoy JAL Lounge Narita board time first impression Boeing 787 good modern plane nice mood light board food wine really good beautifullypresente japanese starter follow bentostyle lunch final reminder holiday wife choose western option plenty choice ife big screen downside cabin hot make difficult sleep flight problem encounter outbound journey seat comfortable recline fully find layout BA Club World little awkward step another passenger footrest access aisle cabin crew efficient seem bit exhausted could friendly welcoming context review spoil fly first class way Tokyo amazing experience comfortable seat exemplary service cabin crew feel bit disappoint return flight comparison feel room improvement time expectation might high previous flight,0.9821,Positive
  London to Tokyo Haneda. My wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucher. We were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was great. We boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably.

" Flying last Sunday from Geneva to Piladelphia via London in business class. When I arrived at the boarding gate in London to take my flight to Philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available! They overbooked! My choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight! They just did not care about their customer. No phone call, no email, no indication at the lounge nothing until I was at the boarding gate. I kindly accepted to take the next flight. The plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues.

" A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand.

"  BA836 on 19 Jan. Excellent short flight from Heathrow to Dublin in Club Europe. Cabin Crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent. The Club Europe catering was excellent, I had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free bread. The main course was beef ratatouille with a Do&Co dessert pot. This was the best inflight meal I've had on a short haul flight.

"  Whatever happened to the World's Favourite Airline? Returning from Bermuda to Gatwick we were presented with a worn-out Boeing 777. My seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off. I had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat, it didn't work, tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food. Reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'I'll put it in the book'. No apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from him. The food was awful, neither my wife or I could finish it. It also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the salad. My wife's entertainment screen, didn't work, the passenger next to me screen didn't work and mine only worked intermittently. It look liked something from the Arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible. I believe the 777s out of Gatwick are being updated, can't come a moment too soon. We purchased Premium Economy tickets for the this flight, we didn't get a premium service. Initially I was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so I'm glad I didn't.

"  Antigua to Gatwick. Apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee.

" I understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat.

In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC?
